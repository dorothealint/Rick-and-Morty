                <p>These are the transcribed episodes we used to pull our data from. We've made them available on the site solely for the purposes of providing a better and more expansive amount of transcription than those already available (via the Rick and Morty Wiki Page).</p>
                <p>Right now, the toggle box highlights stage directions and speakers. In the future, we'd like to parse through the transcript files and seperate each individual speaker so we can highlight lines by speaker.</p>

                    <h3>Season 1 Episode 2: Lawnmower Dog</h3>
                    <span class="stage">Jerry and Summer are in the living room. Jerry is flipping through channels on TV and Summer is texting</span>
<p><span class="speaker">TV</span><span class="dialogue"> Coin collecting is considered the perfect hobby. Beautiful putt right there good birdie. That's only the eighth birdie of the day.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles walks up to Jerry are sits there, looking at him</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside? <span class="stage">Sigh</span></span></p>
<span class="stage">Jerry opens the door to let Snuffles out but he still just stands there</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Outside?</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles pees on the carpet</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Are you kidding me?! Come on!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, my God.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Morty hears his dad yelling and runs into the room to check up on him</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> What's wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Your idiot dog!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!</span></p>
<span class="stage">Jerry grabs Snuffles by the head and stuffs his face into the pee puddle just as Rick walks in</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Ha-ha!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Aw, man!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick goes into the garage and quickly whips up a helmet and comes back and puts it on Snuffles</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> All right, Ruffles What's his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Snuffles.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Snuffles, shake.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles understands his and shakes</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Roll over.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles rolls over</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Go to the bathroom.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles goes out of the room, a toilet flush is heard, and then he returns</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Holy crap!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> No way.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick and Morty go into the garage</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> That was fantastic, Rick!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick shows Morty a tiny metal ear-piece like device</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> W-w-w-what is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> You talking about "Inception"?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may-<span class="stage">Belch</span>-be make sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> "Inception" made sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick and Morty get into the space cruiser and start going off</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Mr. Goldenfold is in his home, watching TV on the couch, eating nachos, half asleep</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> You don't know me!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue">' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Mr. Goldenfold falls asleep just as Rick and Morty sneak in through his window</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Commercial Announcer</span><span class="dialogue"> Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> You don't know me!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> Then let me get to know yo, damn it!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Uh-oh! Spoilers!</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick quickly turns off the TV</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> I'm a full season behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick puts inception devices on everyone and they enter Mr. Goldenfold's dream. Here, he is sitting on the airplane and Mrs. Pancakes is the flight attendant serving snacks</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> Wheat thins. Wheat thins.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> I'll take two.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr.Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> You don't know me.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> All right, Morty, time to make our move.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick grabs some sodas and a cloth while Mr. Goldenfold and Mrs. Pancakes play around with each other</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> Make it bounce.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> No, you didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, jiggle it now.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> You better stop with that.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick and Morty jump out, disguised as Muslim terrorists, wearing soda bottles as bombs and Morty wearing the cloth on his head like an Islamic woman</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Allahu <span class="stage">Belch</span> akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!</span></p>
<span class="stage">The passengers are frozen in shock, but Mr. Goldenfold gets up and stands against him</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!</span></p>
<span class="stage">Mr. Goldenfold throws a bunch of wheat thins at them, and it cuts their flesh like ninja stars</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Take cover, Morty!</span></p>
<span class="stage">Mr. Goldenfold suddenly takes out two giant firearms and starts firing them at the two, just after Rick and Morty hide behind the seats, sheltering themselves from the attacks.</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Ooohhh!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. <span class="stage">Belch</span> I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!</span></p>
<span class="stage">Jerry is in the living room, controlling Snuffles and showing to Beth how cool it is</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Now bring me my slippers.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles brings Jerry his slippers</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Now, be my footstool, Snuffles.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles stands in front of her and Summer rests her feet there</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Beth </span><span class="dialogue"><span class="stage">Unimpressed</span> Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?</span></p>
<span class="stage">Everyone is silent for a few seconds while Beth gives him blank stare. Jerry slowly starts to fade into a depressed state as Beth walks off, leaving him</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something. <span class="stage">Offscreen</span> That is so awesome.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna".</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> Ooooyayawawa!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> He's saying "I love Obama". <span class="stage">Offscreen</span> So cute! I'm posting this <span class="stage">Onscreen</span> online, like, right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?</span></p>
<span class="stage">Jerry and Summer leave the room and Snuffles sadly walks over the the glass door and sees his helmet in the reflection</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> Hmm?</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles finds the battery case on his helmet and then goes into the kitchen, where he finds a drawer full of batteries</span>
<span class="stage">Mr. Goldenfold is still shooting things up in the plane and Rick attempts to make peace with him</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr.Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> Why would I negotiate with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick takes out Mrs. Pancakes</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr. Goldenfold</span><span class="dialogue"> Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Plane Passengers</span><span class="dialogue"> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Plane Passenger</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh no! Run!</span></p>
<span class="stage">One of the passengers beats the airlock off the plane and everyone flies out</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Plane Passengers</span><span class="dialogue"> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick and Morty fall out of the plane, plummeting to their dooms</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick and Morty grab onto Mrs. Pancakes are her parachute deploys</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> Hey, you don't know me!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a <span class="stage">Offscreen</span> mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Pancakes</span><span class="dialogue"> You don't know m-</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick slaps Mrs. Pancakes, knocking her out, and then incepts her dream with Morty</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> All right, let's go.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick and Morty go inside of her dream which is a bizarre S&amp;M dungeon filled with obscure gooey, monstrous, alien-like creatures</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Don't judge, Morty.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Rick leaves Morty and blends in and then Morty in confronted by a sexualized creature</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Sexualized S&amp;M Monster</span><span class="dialogue"> Ooh, hey!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Ooh, oh! Oh, man.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Many more creatures come up and try to seduce him, making him more uncomfortable</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Sexualized S&amp;M Monster</span><span class="dialogue"> Come and join us.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Morty starts running</span>

<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> It's Summer! Aw, geez.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue">Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.</span></p>

<span class="stage">Rick pops the neck of the centaur and they hook up more devices and incept his dream</span>
<span class="stage">Rick and Morty appear in a dark and horrid red rusted chamber where the Centaur is shuttering in fear</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version of a Centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Scary Terry</span><span class="dialogue"> I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> I don't know. It's Indian giving.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Snuffles turns on the TV to a documentary on dogs and starts watching it</span>
<p><span class="speaker">TV</span><span class="dialogue"> A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill.

<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> "Snuffles" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Scary Terry</span><span class="dialogue"> You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> But that's the opposite of what-</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Worst-case scenario we're back to running.</span></p>
<span class="stage">A time lapse transition card shows up, reading "Six dream hours later". Rick and Morty are seen hiding and Scary Terry goes past them, still looking for them and not knowing where they are</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Scary Terry</span><span class="dialogue"> You can run But you can't hide! <span class="stage">Yawn</span></span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Scene cuts back to the dogs. They are working in a factory and Jerry, Summer, and Beth are seen, trapped in a cage.</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Summer</span><span class="dialogue"> Dad, he wants to be called snowball.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Monster Teacher</span><span class="dialogue"> Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, man, what's going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Jerry</span><span class="dialogue"> Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time. <span class="stage">Jerry pees on a pile of guns</span> See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> What? </span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> But I-it's been like a whole year!</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Aw, man, geez! Seriously?</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? </span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> What?! </span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. Dog</span><span class="dialogue"> It's pretty bad, emperor snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Accountant Dog</span><span class="dialogue"> Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Accountant Dog</span><span class="dialogue"> Do you think they would have done this for us? </span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> We are not them! We are not them. <span class="stage">Snuffles wakes up from the dream</span> Assemble the troops. I've made a decision.</span></p>
<span class="stage">Outside where the dogs are seen portaling to another world</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> I'm gonna miss you, snowball.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Snuffles</span><span class="dialogue"> You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Beth</span><span class="dialogue"> Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Rick</span><span class="dialogue"> I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Morty</span><span class="dialogue"> You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.</span></p>
