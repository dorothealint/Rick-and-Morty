(Morty, Rick, and Jerry)

(Everything is frozen besides Morty, Rick and Summer. Morty is vacuuming Jerry with a hand vac.)

(Enter: Summer)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What? What kind of monster are you?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: A competent one.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.</speech>

(Morty puts shirt on Jerry backwards.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Wait a minute, what?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: And away we go!</speech>

(Rick unfreezes time.)

(Mr. Benson falls off the roof.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Shhh, Morty!</speech>

(Jerry opens the door angrily)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: ...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Hi, dad.</speech>

(Summer and Morty recoil from Beth as she approaches to hug Rick)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Summer, Morty, are you okay?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: W-We just missed you a lot.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.</speech>

(Rick motions Summer and Morty behind him.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream, (Rick puts a rubber band around a rolled up wad of cash) go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?</speech>

(Simultaneously---

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: *Gasp*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Uh oh.</speech>

-------------->

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid.</speech>

(Simultaneously---

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Phew...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: *Exhales*</speech>

-------------->

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on. (Morty and Summer laugh) Oh you agree, huh? (Summer: Funny) You like that Red Grin Grumble reference? (Summer: Yeah.) Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.</speech>

[Intro sequence]

[Trans. Outside Morty's house]

(Mr. Benson is being loaded into an ambulance.)

[Trans. Inside Morty's house]

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: God, I feel terrible.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. (Rick opens refrigerator) [Trans. Inside refrigerator] One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!</speech>

[Trans. Inside Morty's house]

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: (interrupting) Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. (Summer pokes Morty.)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Nuh uh!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Yeah huh!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You shut up you big... female asshole!</speech>

(Alternate selves first appear)

Alternate Morty: Hey, don't shove me!

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: I didn't!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You didn't what?</speech>

Alternate Summer: What's your problem?

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What's yours?</speech>

Alternate Summer: Shut up!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You shut up!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?</speech>

(Time splits into two - alternate timelines will be ordered from top to bottom, left to right.)

All Ricks: Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: What do you mean?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 2: What could we do?</speech>

All Summers: Wait, what am I saying?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *belch* Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?</speech>

All Mortys: Oh man... I don't feel good.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1: Am I me? I think so.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: A-am I talking right now?</speech>

All Mortys: Wait, who said that?

All Ricks: Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: What should we do Morty?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 2: I'm gonna help Grampa.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1: Let's see if he needs help.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: What do you mean you're gonna help him.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: Ugh, I can help too.</speech>

[Trans. Inside Rick's garage]

All Mortys: What's going on Rick?

All Summers: What's happening Grampa?

All Ricks: Shut up! (Rick turns on a monitor) Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1: What do you mean?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: What? In English?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: What? English please?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 2: What are you talking about?</speech>

All Ricks: Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.

All Mortys: But I thought there were infinite timelines.

All Ricks: We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.

(Rick opens the garage door, revealing floating cats, trees and islands.)

All Mortys: Oh, my God!

All Summers: Are those cats?

All Ricks: I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1 &amp; Morty 2: Is the world gone? Where are Mom and Dad?</speech>

All Ricks: “Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh*t marriage.

[Trans. Inside Jerry's car]

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.</speech>

(Jerrry hits a deer.)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Holy shit! What happened?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: W-what?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: This is Rum Raisin!</speech>

(Beth hands Jerry her ice cream, gets out of the car and goes over to the deer.)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: It's still alive.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or--</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: It's not an armadillo, asshole!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: So...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Well don't different animals-</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Require different levels of skill to keep alive?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh God...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Get the deer in the car, Jerry.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Yes Beth.</speech>

[Trans. Inside Rick's garage]

All Ricks: This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1: And you did it so you could clean the house after a party.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?</speech>

All Ricks: Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be “is”.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1: Or...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: Or?</speech>

All Ricks: We “isn't”

All Ricks: Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1 &amp; Summer 2: How do you know you're gonna-</speech>

All Ricks: Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!

(Rick presses a button, the timelines almost merge)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Huh, what do you know, it's working</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: Ow, ow ouch!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: Whoa, ow, ow.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh shit.</speech>

(Realities separate again)

All Ricks: What the hell is wrong with you two!? I—I m—I m—I mean you four!?

All Mortys and Summer 2: That hurt! That was painful...

All Ricks: Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both *belch* all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f***ing wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!

All Mortys: Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1: You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 2: Me? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous, because you want Grampa all to yourself!</speech>

All Ricks: Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.

[Trans. Outside animal hospital.]

[Trans. Inside animal hospital.]

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Emergency, wounded deer coming in.</speech>

[Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.]

(Vet is taking a snake's pulse.)

Vet: Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.</speech>

Vet: That's my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!</speech>

Vet: Geez...

(Vet removes Snake from operating table. Beth and Jerry place deer on operating table.)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: That's odd, this deer's wounded.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I mean it's been shot. With a gun.</speech>

Hunter: My gun.

Vet: May I help you, sir?

Hunter: No, but you can stop helping this deer. I shot it before these two hit it with their car and I followed them when they hauled it off. This deer belongs to me.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth:</speech>

    sigh* We don't have time for this, okay! I need anesthetic, and deer saline! 

Vet: Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal.

Hunter: I'm calling my lawyer. I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!</speech>

[Trans. Inside Rick's garage.]

All Ricks: So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?

All Mortys and All Summers: Yes.

All Ricks: Alright, perfect. Sit still, *belch* arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: You mean drunk?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 2: What's that? You got something to say?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 1: And away we go!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: No.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 2: And away we go!</speech>

All Ricks: Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God.

All Summers: What?

All Ricks: That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 2: Follicle unfeeling sociopath. Don't you get it? He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 1: Don't you get it? don't you get it? The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...</speech>

All Mortys: Rick what the hell are you doing?

All Ricks: Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!

All Summers: Who?

All Ricks: Me!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 2: You see that? Get down.</speech>

All Summers: Ahh!

All Mortys: Whoa whoa!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 1: I told you he's a psycho!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 2: He's lost it. The time fracture must have made him crazy!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 1: I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 2 or 4 after splitting into 4 (not shown): Oh crap!</speech>

(Reality splits into 4 parts)

All Ricks: Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?

[Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.]

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!</speech>

Lawyer: Michael.

Vet: Who's this now?

Hunter: My lawyer.

Lawyer: I'm here to notify you ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property, regardless of how far it runs, or who intercepts it before it dies. It's called Brad's law. We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point you're performing it on venison.

Hunter: Actually, I've decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict. I'm sure it's ruined the meat. I'm just gonna use the head for my rec room wall.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: She normally works on horses.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!</speech>

Vet: Jesus...

[Trans. Inside Rick's garage.]

All Ricks: Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!

(Morty knocks Rick out with a fire extinguisher)

All Summers: Holy shit, now what?

All Mortys: Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?

All Summers: Right.

All Mortys: Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.

All Summers: Right...

All Mortys: I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.

[Cut to black]

[Trans. Outside the house in Schrodinger cat space]

All Ricks: Oh God, my head. What did you guys do?

All Mortys: We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.

All Summers: You tried to kill yourself!

All Ricks: Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.

All Summers: Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?

All Ricks: Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.

All Mortys: W-what're you doing?

All Ricks: Calling myself. Here, listen, *belch* it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.

All Rick phones: Hello, Rick here.

All Ricks: Don't fall for it, it's a bit.

All Rick phones: Just kidding, haha! You just got Ricked. You've reached Rick's voicemail, you know what to do *beep*.

All Ricks: Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails. *voicemail repeats* Yeah yeah, I heard this one. *voicemail repeats two more times* You get the idea *belch* we're cool now.

All Summers: Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.

All Ricks: Fine I'll just do it myself.

All Mortys: If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?

All Ricks: Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.

All Mortys: You know, geez Rick, y—y—you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.

(Testicle Monster A floats into view in a bubble.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1: Oh, my God!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2: It's a monster!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 3: Oh, my God! It's a monster!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: It's a monster!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 4: It's a monster!</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Ey, ye ey, quit yellin' quit yellin'.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1: *Screams*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 4: Oh, my God...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 2, 3 and 4: *Screams*</speech>

Testicle Monster A: What the fuck?! Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time, twice!

All Ricks: *sigh*

Testicle Monster A: How did this happen?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summers 2 &amp; 3: Yeah, but we don't even know, the first time...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1 &amp; 4: Who's that Brother Newman time elf?</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Shut the fuck up! Oh, damn, I'm from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o' y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second.

All Ricks: *groan*

Testicle Monster A: Ay, damn it, were you tryin' to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies?

All Mortys: Oh way to go, Rick.

All Summers: Yeah Grampa, way to go.

All Ricks: Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.

Testicle Monster A: Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on!

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1, 2 and 3: What are you talking about?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1, 2 and 3: We have them on.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 1, 2 and 3: Uh, we did...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 4: We're not wearing collars.</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Exactly, because you're being obstinate.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 1, 2 and 3: *belch* What?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 1, 2 and 3: We did!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 1, 2 and 3: They're on right now.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 4: Alright, fine. Summer, Morty, put 'em on.</speech>

(Alternate timelines merge into one)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yes, we're back, problem solved.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Yes, we're back to our own time.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Well since you're goin' to time prison, I'd say you can keep em on forever.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Time prison?</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Yeah, well I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin' ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Ututututut! You'd better keep back! Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.

[Trans. Inside animal hospital operating room.]

Vet: Hmm...

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?</speech>

Lawyer: That's right Mrs. Smith, *whispers* give in to your anger. Neglect that deer.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends.</speech>

Vet: I guess that's the end of that.

Lawyer: There is just one more thing. According to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. You heard the man horse doctor, you have to say you couldn't hack it.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: We did it...</speech>

[Trans. Inside Rick's garage.]

Testicle Monster A: (On phone) Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, I'm talking 'bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you've get to the dolphin people, you've gone too far. Alright man, I'll talk to you later, okay. (hangs up) You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Why are you doing this?</speech>

Testicle Monster A: You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin' you guys in is my ticket up.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?</speech>

Testicle Monster A: You really think I'm that stupid?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.</speech>

Testicle Monster A: I cannot argue that.

(Rick hits the creature with a wrench and grabs the organic gun he was holding)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ah, God, gross and weird!</speech>

(Rick drops the gun and it crawls toward the street)

Testicle Monster A: Chris!

(The gun/Chris runs into the road and is run over by a car)

Testicle Monster A: You killed my gun!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Summer, Morty, take off your collars!</speech>

Testicle Monster A: What? What the hell are you doing?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Good question. I suppose the answer is: I'm not certain!</speech>

Testicle Monster A: Oh, no, what are you doin'?

(Time splits into 2 timelines)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 1: I have no idea!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 2: I'm not sure.</speech>

(Time splits into 4 timelines)

All Ricks (off sync): Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

(Time Splits into 8 timelines)

All Ricks (off sync): I'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass!

Testicle Monster A: Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago.

All Summers (off sync): Come on, let's help Grampa.

All Mortys (off sync): Yeah. I'm like a hundred percent not sure about anything.

(Time splits twice, now 32 Timelines)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summers 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20, 25, 28, 29, 31: Beat his ass!</speech>

(Zooms into only show one timeline: Timeline 23)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 23: Kick his ass, Rick!</speech>

(Ricks, Mortys, and Summers hit Testicle Monster A one last time, he falls back and his head explodes.)

Testicle Monster A: Ow, I'm defeated...

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer 23: What's happening?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 23: Time is falling apart, we've got to get back to certainty, quick! Give me your collars!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 23: Oh man, don't you have to fix, like, thirty of them?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 23: Morty, I have to fix three of them, and then there's thirty-one other versions of me that have to also fix three for a total of 96. I'm not an idiot. I know how to be decisive, now hand me that (Phillips/Flathead) screwdriver. Actually, make it a (Phillips/Flathead).</speech>

(Time splits into 64 timelines)

All Ricks (off sync): Oh, shit.

[Trans. Inside Jerry's car]

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Where are we going?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: One last stop.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Where's the helicopter?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: But the top deer surgeon...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that.</speech>

Cold Stone Employee: You'd better get moving, these lights are designed for basic ice cream work, they're not gonna last all night.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I need five minutes.</speech>

(Short slow-panning montage of surgery)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.</speech>

Cold Stone Employee: You're welcome.

(Zoom into Timeline 30)

(Presumably) All Ricks: Okay, we're out of time. It's ironic, huh?

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 30: Rick!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 30: What's goin' on?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 30: The collar, oh, the latch is broken! It won't latch closed around my neck!</speech>

(Zoom pan to Timeline 28)

(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: What's wrong, how come our collars aren't green?

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on and one of me is stuck trying to help him.

(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: Don't blame this on me, you're the one that couldn't fix a latch!

(Zoom pan to Timeline 30)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 30: What are you talking about, it's not broken, Morty, I fixed it, just put it on!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 30: It won't close, it's broken!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 30: Fine, bring it here.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 30: Ooh, ooh, Rick!</speech>

(Zoom pan to Timeline 15)

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: Oh, really, Morty? Well I'm sorry, I'm not the one that's so fucking uncertain about everything!

(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this, I never wanna see you again!

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: You're never gonna see anything again you little dummy! You killed us!

(Zoom pan to Timeline 30)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 30: Goddammit!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 30: Ooh</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 30: Morty where's your collar I'll fix it</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty 30: I dropped it</speech>

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 30: I'm okay with this. Be good Morty. Be better than me. Bullsh*t The other collar! I'm not okay with this! I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus please let me live. Oh, my God I—I've gotta fix this thing, please God in Heaven, please, God, oh Lord, hear my prayers. Yes! Fuck you God! Not today, bitch.</speech>

(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: Please, God, if there's a Hell, please be merciful to me.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick 30: Yes I did it! There is no God! In your face. One dot, motherfuckers!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Yes, oh, yes, yes!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Hey guys, we're home.</speech>

(Summer and Morty run up and hug Beth and Jerry, respectively.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty &amp; Summer: Mom, Dad!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: *laughs*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: *laughing* I'm gonna pee my pants.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Doesn't feel so good, does it?</speech>

Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk?</speech>

Transcript

[Open Ext. Rick's Ship in Outer Space]

(Morty drives, Rick sits in the passenger seat, and Jerry is in the back.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You’re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Cool.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *points out the window* See that planet right there? Don’t fly too close to that planet. Someone’ll come out and try to wash your windshield. (Rick’s phone rings.) Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. *hangs up* Alright Morty, lesson’s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh, you still use ‘south’ in space?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *startled* WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: What are you talking about? We agreed a boy’s father should be present when he’s learning to drive.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I guess I remember that. *rubs forehead* Wow. And you’ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don’t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *chuckles* Cool! Looks like I’m comin’ along for an adventure!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yep.</speech>

[Trans. Empty space]

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: This is where we’re going?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Nope. (An asteroid-like mass materializes before them.) This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.</speech>

(Morty parks clumsily.)

[Trans. Int. Jerryboree]

(Human Music plays in the lobby as Rick signs Jerry in.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry-Sitter: Well look at this fella. *pinches Jerry’s cheek* Aren’t you handsome?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Thank you! I’m Jerry. *extends hand*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry-Sitter: *as if speaking to a child* Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?</speech>

(She guides Jerry through a set of doors.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I’m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry-Sitter: Oh, they’ll be back soon.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: What?</speech>

(A set of sliding doors open, revealing a room full of Jerrys from different dimensions.)

Pajama Jerry: I don’t know how this works!

Underpants Jerry: Help me!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: What the hell?</speech>

Pajama Jerry: I know, right?

Tuxedo Jerry: *enters room* Oh, what the hell?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I know, right?</speech>

[Trans. Jerryboree Lobby]

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *looking at a pamphlet* Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well… I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy’s rich.</speech>

Receptionist: Don’t forget to check the reason for your drop-off.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *checks off “Stowaway” and “Annoying me”* Trust me Morty, I’ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn’t be safer.</speech>

(As they walk out, Rick hands Morty a ticket.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number’s your dad. If you lose it, we’re not gonna be able to get him back.</speech>

[Intro sequence]

[Trans. Parking garage]

(Morty parks the ship clumsily, damaging nearby vehicles.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Okay, wait here.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I wanna come with.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Don’t come with. It’s boring, it’s *burps* business stuff.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th—in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ‘em in cocaine, and they wipe ‘em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn’t shady.</speech>

(Krombopulos Michael knocks on Rick’s window.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ah, crap. *rolls down window* Hey, what’s up?</speech>

Krombopulos Michael: Hey, Rick! Haha! Here you go, three thousand Flurbos! D’you have the weapon?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Can… Can we please…? This is my grandson, Morty.</speech>

Krombopulos Michael: Well hi Morty! I’m Krombopulos Michael! I’m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away.</speech>

Krombopulos Michael: *examines weapon* Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots antimatter? My target can’t be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty! Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered, *passes Morty his card* please give me a call. I’m very discrete—

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Y-Y-Y-You’re gonna give him your card?!</speech>

Krombopulos Michael: I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn’t matter. I just love killin’!

(Krombopulos Michael leaves.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: …You sell weapons to killers for money?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ugh… You’ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It’s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Uh, what?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!</speech>

[Trans. Blips and Chitz]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Aw, this place is the best. It’s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty’s head* Here, check this out.</speech>

(Morty’s eyes roll back into his head.)

[Trans. Roy’s room]

Roy: Ah!

(Roy wakes up, frightened and panting.)

Roy’s mother: Roy, what’s wrong?

Roy: I…had a nightmare. I was with an old man… He put a helmet on me.

Roy’s mother: It’s just a fever. Get some sleep, I don’t want you missing school on Monday. *walks out of the room and switches off the lights*

[Trans. Roy’s school]

Teacher: I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. (Roy looks outside and sees kids playing with a football. He smiles.) Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.

[Trans. Football game]

(Roy is now older, and a football player.)

Announcer: Spiraling perfectly, it’s gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20! (Roy makes eye contact with a girl in the stands.) Now he’s at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy the Rocket! Touchdown!

[Trans. Roy’s kitchen]

(Roy is older, now married to the girl from the football game with a young son. They’re eating dinner.)

Roy’s wife: I just think it’s time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy?

[Trans. Carpet store]

(Roy now works at the carpet store. He gets a call from his doctor.)

[Trans. Doctor’s office]

Doctor: Had we caught it sooner… Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What’s important is that we move quickly.

[Trans. Hospital room]

(Roy is battling cancer. His wife, older, sits with him.)

Roy: I’m not…ready to die…

Roy’s wife: *takes his hand* You’re not going to.

[Trans. Roy’s house]

(Roy survived surgery. His wife wheelchairs him into the house, where friends and relatives applaud his entry. A streamer reads “CANCER CAN’T BEAT THE ROCKET”)

[Trans. Carpet store]

(Roy is older still, now greying and wearing glasses.)

Customer: Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy.

(Roy shakes his hand, then sits and looks fondly at a trophy that reads “World’s Greatest Dad.”)

Voice: *shouting from off screen* Hey Roy, you pull those Persian off-white shags for the clearance sale?

(Roy gets up and steps onto a short ladder to retrieve the rugs. He loses his balance.)

Roy: Whoa. Sh-shit! Shit!

(He hits the ground and dies. Text reads “GAME OVER”.)

[Trans. Blips and Chitz]

(Morty regains consciousness and removes the helmet, frightened and confused.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?! What the hell?!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *looks around, grips his head* W… Where’s my wife?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty. You were just playing a game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I’m Morty… You’re Rick… Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.</speech>

(Rick sits in the seat to play Roy.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Don’t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: It’s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there’s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That’s why he does it for a living? Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Uh-huh, yeah, that’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.</speech>

Alien: *passing by, sees Rick playing Roy* Holy shit! This guy’s taking Roy off the grid! (Other alien patrons gasp and congregate around Rick.) This guy doesn’t have a social security number for Roy!

(Morty looks at Krombopulos Michael’s business card, which shows his location, and walks away.)

[Trans. Jerryboree]

(Jerry approaches the Jerrysitter from earlier.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I’m an adult and would like to go home, please.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry-Sitter: Well of course! Right through that tube. *points to a tube in the wall*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *muttering to self* Unbelievable. *approaches the tube and starts climbing in*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry-Sitter: You’re doing great!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *indignantly* I know how to crawl in a tube. *to himself, while crawling* Ugh… Come on… This is harder than it looks… (Suddenly the tube transitions into a slide.) Whoooooaaaa!</speech>

(Jerry lands in a ballpit in an area designed similarly to the Smith house. Other Jerrys are in the ballpit playing Marco Polo.)

Pink-shirt Jerry: Marco? (Jerrys laugh.) Marco?

Other Jerry: Come find me.

Pink-shirt Jerry: Marco? (Jerrys laugh again.)

(Our Jerry seems disturbed.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: You guys are enjoying this? Don’t you feel a little… patronized?</speech>

Pink-shirt Jerry: How so?

(Someone dressed in a large Beth costume approaches the ballpit.)

Daycare Beth: Jerry!

Other Jerry: Beeeth.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!</speech>

Daycare Beth: I love you, Jerry!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Aw… Beth…</speech>

Daycare Beth: Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director’s commentary on?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerrys: Oh! Yes! Definitely!</speech>

Daycare Beth: First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!

(Jerrys become more excited.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: The factory tint setting is always too high! *climbs out of the ballpit and hurries after “Beth” with the other Jerrys*</speech>

Other Jerry: Out of my way!

Another Jerry: The factory tint setting is always too high!

[Timeskip]

(Daycare Beth sits on a couch with a Jerry on each side of her and dozens of other Jerrys surrounding them, watching Midnight Run.)

[Trans. Government outpost]

(Krombopulos Michael prepares to carry out the hit. He holds up a heart shaped locket with a picture of a presumed romantic partner in it, kisses the locket, and puts it away.)

Krombopulos Michael: Oh boy, here I go killin’ again!

(Krombopulos Michael sneaks through the building, killing several Gromflomite guards along the way before arriving in the chamber his target is kept. His target appears to be a strange, gaseous being. Krombopulos Michael draws his weapon, but before he can shoot, Morty crashes Rick’s ship through the ceiling, crushing him.)

Ship: You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *dazed* All out of off-white Persians… *gets out of the ship and realizes he killed Krombopulos Michael* Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! *picks up KM’s arm and the antimatter gun*</speech>

Gromflomite: (pointing a gun at Morty) Drop the gun!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You don’t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!</speech>

Gromflomite: I guess that makes two of us. *fires up his weapon*

(A portal forms through the guard, bisecting him down the middle, and Rick walks out of it.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don’t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don’t get along!</speech>

Fart: You saved my life!

(Rick and Morty both turn to face the gaseous being.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael’s target? W-Wwwwhat’s your name?</speech>

Fart: My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call “Jessica’s feet.” No, “telepathy.”

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!</speech>

Fart: I like this name, ‘Fart.’ Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty, don’t do it. (Morty walks toward the lever.) Morty… (Morty glances at Rick before pulling the lever. Alarms start to sound as Fart escapes his cell.) Morty, you idiot!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh crap, let’s get you outta here!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: We can’t get him outta here. He’s gaseous. He’s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *stomps past Rick* Well then I guess we’re all getting in the car! Right, uh…</speech>

Fart: Fart.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!</speech>

(Fart floats into the car and Morty sits in the driver’s seat.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don’t wanna deal with this!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Y-You’ve been clear on the fact that you don’t wanna help, so just go away!</speech>

Fart: More are coming.

(Rick starts walking off.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Screw this. I’m out.</speech>

(Rick forms a portal and leaves through it. Morty tries to start the car as a Gromflomite approaches, but it stalls.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oooh…! Come on, come on!</speech>

Gromflomite: Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *still trying to start the car* Oh no no no!</speech>

Gromflomite: Open fire!

(A portal appears directly above the guards and water pours out of it, flooding the room. Another portal appears on the floor, and the water and Gromflomites are sucked into it. A third portal then appears and Rick emerges through it, walking up to the car.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! *shoves Morty out of the driver’s seat and takes the wheel* Move!</speech>

(Fart moves to the backseat as Morty takes the passenger seat.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?</speech>

(Morty buckles up and Rick begins adjusting the seat settings.)

Fart: More are coming.

(More Gromflomites storm into the room. Rick continues adjusting the seat.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah, yeah. (He crashes the car into the Gromflomites before flying away from the outpost.)</speech>

[Trans. Gear World, Int. Gearhead’s shop/residence]

(Rick, Morty, and Fart wait while Gearhead works on the car. Morty and Fart are watching Gazorpazorpfield.)

Gearhead: Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.</speech>

Gearhead: Actually, it’s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they’re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire—

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *interrupts him* So I’ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.</speech>

Fart: You do understand I’m telepathic, right?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I’m being polite.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick, we’re taking him back where he belongs!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah, where’s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?</speech>

Fart: I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call “get out of my head, Fart, I know you’re in here, la la la la—” No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…</speech>

Fart: Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: That’s how things should be. It’s how they could be.</speech>

Fart: I could not agree more.

(Fart envelops Morty as “Goodbye Moonmen” begins.)

Fart: (singing over a montage formed from Morty’s imagination) The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. / The ground can be space (space, space, space, space) / With feet marching toward a peaceful sky. / All the moonmen want things their way / But we make sure they see the sun. / Goodbye, moonmen / You say goodbye, moonmen. / Goodby—

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *holding a golf club* Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn’t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!</speech>

[Trans. Jerryboree]

(A roomful of Jerrys on computers forward each other joke emails.)

Random Jerry: *opens email and laughs* Duck, duck, birdie? (All Jerrys open emails and laugh.) Very funny!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Here comes another funny…</speech>

Other Jerry: Hahaha! Oh, this place is great.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I almost wish I could stay longer than one day.</speech>

Other Jerry: *suddenly serious* You just might.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: W-What do you mean?</speech>

[Trans. Room of Forgotten Jerrys]

(The other Jerry from before leads our Jerry inside.)

Other Jerry: These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back. (Forgotten Jerrys stand, sit, and lie around the room, generally looking despondent.) …They live here now.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Uuuum…</speech>

[Trans. Gearhead’s place]

(Gearhead continues working on the car while the others watch Ball Fondlers. The show is cut off by Breaking News.)

Gear Anchor: No gear turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives (An image of Rick and Morty in the car as Rick was adjusting the seat settings appears onscreen.) reportedly at large somewhere within the Gear System.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Son of a… *approaches Fart* Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?</speech>

Fart: I am no more valuable than life itself. However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this. (An electric fuzz seems to go through the gaseous cloud and a lump of gold materializes, dropping to the ground beneath him.) That was oxygen. I added seventy-one protons to it.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *picks up the gold* Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin’ for us! *pockets gold* Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that’s gonna be to my work?</speech>

(Sirens sound outside. Rick rushes to the window and sees police in flying vehicles have surrounded the place.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead… *turns around*</speech>

Gearhead: *pointing a gun at Rick* I’m sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you gotta look out for Number One.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Number One is me, asshole! You’re supposed to be my friend!</speech>

Gearhead: Friend? Do you even know my real name? It’s Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire species of gear people. Calling me ‘Gearhead’ is like calling a Chinese person ‘Asia-face.’

(Rick notices a nearby box of twigs, marked with a warning. He throws them at Gearhead and they get caught in his mouth, causing him to drop the gun.)

Gearhead: No, not twigs!

(Rick kicks Gearhead in the crotch, removes his gear-testicles, pulls two gears out of his mouth, and shoves the gear-testicles in their place while Gearhead moans in pain, clutching his mouth and groin.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it’s time to go.</speech>

(Rick, Morty, and Fart get in the car and fly out through a window. Two gear police enter.)

Gear Policeman #1: Nobody move!

(Gearhead waves his hands, trying to communicate. The officers see how he’s been disfigured.)

Gear Policeman #2: Oh my god.

Gear Policeman #1: Are those…?

(Both vomit oil and metal.)

[Trans. Ext. Gear World]

(Rick leads police on a flying chase, shooting and driving at the same time. Numerous police cars crash, killing officers and civilians.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I did the right thing, Rick!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Tell that to Gearhead’s gearsticles.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You did that!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wrong! I’d be playin’ Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.</speech>

(Both don expressions of surprise as helicopters appear in front of them. Rick quickly steers the craft away and the chase continues.)

[Trans. Forgotten Jerrys room]

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *playing poker with other Jerrys, sighs* I can’t believe Rick did this. This is the eighth to the last straw.</speech>

Bearded Jerry: Ante up.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: You know what? *throws down cards* Screw it! I have a better gamble for your guys. *leans forward* I say we escape.</speech>

(Other Jerrys stare at him for several seconds.)

Bearded Jerry: If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door.

Tank-top Jerry: You think we’re kept here against our will? That would be illegal.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: But… If you can leave, then why are you still here?</speech>

Buzzcut Jerry: Same reason as you. *looks to other Jerrys for confirmation* …We’re Jerrys.

(Jerry stands in disgust.)

[Trans. Jerryboree lobby]

(Jerry is marching out.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I’m leaving.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry-Sitter: Okay then, that was always allowed.</speech>

[Trans. Gearworld]

(The chase is still on. Rick stops his vehicle, and Gromflomite ships pass him, giving him a chance to shoot them. He drives off again and pulls out a gun.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty, take the wheel!</speech>

(Rick and Morty clumsily swap seats.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Whoa, whoa!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Whoa!</speech>

(Rick climbs into his seat as Morty buckles up.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?! *laughs* Haha, I’m kidding, I know that’s on me.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Um, Rick!</speech>

(An enormous craft lowers down before them. At this point, the car is surrounded.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Shit. Well, I guess this is it.</speech>

Fart: Morty, crack the window.

(Morty open the window and Fart flies out, entering a gear policecar and entering the officer’s mind.)

Fart: I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.

Officer: Well… He’d probably like to have me to himself, that’s how friends are.

Fart: Or does he want her to himself?

(Fart induces an image in the officer’s mind of Greg having sex with his girlfriend. “Goodbye Moonmen” begins again.)

Fart: The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes.

Officer: *anguished* My life is a fucking joke.

(He crashes his cruiser, setting off a chain of destruction of police and government vehicles as Fart continues singing. Rick and Morty look on from the car, shocked.)

Fart: Goodbye, moonmen. / You say, goodbye, moonmen.

(The destruction beings to kill civilians of Gearworld.)

Fart: Goodbye, moonmen… (Fart floats back in through the window and the song ends.) Alright, let’s proceed.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Damn. Can’t blame that on the dog. …Talk about silent but deadly. I-I’ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I’m sayin’?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *not amused* Are you done?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I’ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don’t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like…if I said Gasablanca! …Alright, I’m done. (Morty starts driving.) Let’s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin’ a life!</speech>

[Trans. Cross-temporal asteroid, customs]

(Jerry walks through a set of sliding doors and gets in line, intent on finding a way back home. He approaches the window.)

Garblovian: Ga-ga blahg blahg?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Um… Earth, please?</speech>

(The alien stamps a ticket and passes it to Jerry.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Um… Is this… Do I pay?</speech>

Garblovian: Agah blahg-blah! (Jibberish continues as Jerry rushes away. Other aliens heckle him.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Sorry!</speech>

[Trans. Ext. Cross-temporal asteroid]

(Jerry passes a homeless alien holding a sign that says “WHY LIE? WILL USE GLEMS FOR GLOOBIES!” He then spots a creature that appears somewhat like a small hairless dog.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Hmm. Hmm… *hesitantly makes to pet the creature, but its face suddenly splays out in a tentacle formation* Agh! *runs away*</speech>

(Jerry runs into an alleyway where he’s met by a shirtless Garblovian, holding out a cup.)

Garblovian: Agah blahg blahg?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I don’t…</speech>

Garblovian: *angrily* Agah blahg!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: What do you want?</speech>

Garblovian: *holds out cup* Agah blahg blah—

(The alien suddenly explodes into bluish goo. Some of it gets on Jerry.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh! *looks at self and begins panicking* Ahahaaaahhhhh….</speech>

(Two smaller Garblovians run up to Jerry, jabbering and holding out cups. Jerry runs away, and one drinks some of the bluish goo from its cup.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *wiping goo off himself* Uhhh… Huhhh…. (Stumbles upon two fleshy alien creatures mid-coitus.) Oooh! *runs away*</speech>

(Jerry now sits on a lone bench under a streetlight, looking around the alien world in obvious fear and flinching at strange noises.)

[Trans. Int. Jerryboree]

(Jerry walks back inside, hanging his head. The Jerry-Sitter smiles cheerfully. He approaches some of the same Jerrys from before. They’re trying to set up a television.)

Tank-top Jerry: Hey, are you the one that left?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *single nod*</speech>

Tank-top Jerry: I get it. It’s… uh… a hassle out there.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *suddenly less forlorn* Right? Who needs that?</speech>

Other Jerrys: *to one another* Right? Not me.

Paul: Oh-ho, not us!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Uh… Who are you?</speech>

Paul: Oh, excuse me. Paul Fleishman. *shakes Jerry’s hand* Infinite timelines! In some of them Beth remarries.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: …Geez…</speech>

Paul: Don’t worry. I treat Beth very well, and I do not overstep my bounds with Morty. Every kid needs a dad, but there’s no replacing you. Hey, you wanna give us a hand with this? *gestures to the TV* We’re trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the TV. I-I-I don’t—It’s very difficult.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh. Uh, well, is there an Aux input?</speech>

Tank-top Jerry: I tried that, but there’s two different colors.

(Pans out to show several clusters of Jerrys also working on identical television sets.)

Various Jerrys: Uh… There’s two different colors.

[Trans. Promethean Nebula]

(Dinosaur-like creatures eat plant matter in what appears to be a vast jungle. Rick’s ship flies into view. Rick is now behind the wheel.)

Fart: The wormhole is seventy of what you call ‘meters’ what you call ‘north’ of what you call ‘here.’

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I’m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty. (Morty gets out of the car.) That’s my new word for ‘shit’ because of today’s events.</speech>

(Morty and Fart head north, soon finding the wormhole.)

Fart: Here it is. This should take me back to my kind.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I’m gonna miss you, um, Fart. I’m really sorry your name became Fart.</speech>

Fart: I will be back soon, Morty.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *excited* Really?</speech>

Fart: After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Um… Cleansing…?</speech>

Fart: Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life. To us, you are what you would call a disease. Wherever we discover you, we cure it. You said yourself that life must be protected even through sacrifice. (Morty, shocked and saddened, begins to tear up.) You haven’t changed your mind about that. I can sense your thoughts. Morty.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *wipes his eyes* Um… Before you go… Could you sing a… C-Could you sing for me again?</speech>

Fart: Yes, Morty. *approaches him as “Goodbye Moonmen” begins, again set to a sequence formed from Morty’s imagination* Cosmos without hatred / Blinding stars of cosmic light / Quasars shine through endless night / And everything is one in the beauty / And now we say goodby—

(The song is interrupted as Morty shoots Fart with the antimatter gun.)

Fart: Morty… Why… Why?

(Morty shoots him several more times until he completely vanishes, then drops the gun, crying.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Goodbye.</speech>

(Rick is loading something into the ship as Morty returns.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard? (Morty wordlessly enters the car.) Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.</speech>

[Trans. Open space]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin’ that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn’t for nothin’, you know? *notices Morty’s detached, almost anguished expression* You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I’ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they’re all coming to visit.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: *panicking* What?! Rick! No, you can’t!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Too late, Morty. The hole’s opening.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: No, no, Rick! You don’t understand!</speech>

(Rick farts.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Th-there’s a lot more where that came from too.</speech>

[Trans. Jerryboree]

(Our Rick and Morty enter the lobby, which is filled with Ricks, Mortys, and Jerrys.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey. *taps another Rick’s arm* Hey bro. How many people was your Roy responsible for killing today?</speech>

Other Rick: None, we chilled at Blips and Chitz all day, ain’t that right homie?

Other Morty: Darn right bro! Roy rules!

Other Rick: Haha!

(The other Rick and Morty leave with their Jerry.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *glares at Morty* Must be nice… Hey, Morty, there’s our Jerry.</speech>

(The Jerry-sitter guides a Jerry toward them. He and Morty hug.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Mm, I missed you. Hey, Rick.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Glad you’re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I’d like that.</speech>

Another Rick: *holding a ticket* Hey, wait, do you have 5126?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Uh, I’m not sure. Morty.</speech>

(Morty pulls a ticket out of his pocket.)

Other Rick: Uh, that’s a Blips and Chitz ticket.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What?!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.</speech>

(The Ricks exchange Jerrys. Both Jerrys look uncertain and nervous.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerrys: Uh… W-wait, what?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Ricks: Alright, come on, Jerry.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You're excited about that?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!</speech>

[Rick makes a sharp turn]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Uh, what's that?</speech>

Female alien: Can you help us? Our planet was taken over by some kind of [pauses] entity! It absorbed the minds of our people!

Male alien 1: We didn't notice until it was too late. The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not, themselves any more; They're part of It.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.</speech>

(Two male aliens are calm and not panting and standing apart from the other four)

Male alien with glasses: Hey! No, no- uurgh!

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: You mean stealing peoples’ bodies?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.</speech>

Unity (Customer): From there I’ll have access to countless planets and species.

Unity (Pedestrian): One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the single-minded once called a god.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: [burps] I like that. Oh, that’s pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?</speech>

Unity (Old woman): Recreational substances were phased out here. There’s no need for escape from the self when your world is one.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.</speech>

Unity (Worker): Rick, when we met I was a young hivemind with the population of a small town. People… change.

Unity (Busker): Especially when I change them. I’m sorry to disappoint you, but… I’ve grown.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey, listen, I’ve grown too. I have! See, I’ve- I’ve reconnected with my family, right?</speech>

Unity (Police officer): Hm, why is that I wonder?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Maybe it’s part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with… a collective.</speech>

(Rick and Unity start kissing. A crowd forms around them)

Unity (Crowd): Yes Rick! Yes! Yes!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh yeah!</speech>

Unity (Crowd): Yes! Yes!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!</speech>

[Trans. to a mountain being carved into the shape of Morty and Summer’s heads. Morty and Summer are being fanned and eating hamburgers]

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Look at ‘em go! So coordinated! What’s your problem? They’re making you into a Mount Rushmore! They made burgers!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Morty, open your eyes! There is no they! These poor people’s’ bodies are being used! They’re a planet of puppets!</speech>

Unity (Fan holder): I can hear you.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Ugh!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Well, seems like everybody here’s cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they’re in a hurry to be somewhere else.</speech>

Unity (Clown): Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: No, we don’t want your dumb balloons. We’re bored. Take us back to Rick.</speech>

Unity (Clown): Now’s… not a good time.

[Trans. to Rick in a hang glider and Uncle Sam costume, flying towards a stadium]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!</speech>

Unity (Stadium): Go son go! Go son go! Go son go!

[Trans. to Earth: Jerry and Beth are looking down the hatch, which is open]

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh! Real nice! Real nice! How does a man do this without me noticing?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh, you know my dad. Once he puts his mind to something…</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: You’re spinning this to his credit?</speech>

(Gurgling)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I’m going down there.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Jerry!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair,  and my faceless gargler. Now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Okay, you’re just making stuff up now.</speech>

[Trans. to Rick, who’s walking out in a bathrobe, panting, to applause]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh my god. Oh my god. [Drinks water]</speech>

Unity (Redheads): Oh Rick, it was so bad.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What’s this ‘was’ stuff? I just need to hydrate and then we’re doing that again!</speech>

(Beta-7’s spaceships arrive from skyward)

Unity (Redhead): Oh damn.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I’ll- I’ll be back to have sex with the survivors.</speech>

Unity (Redhead): It’s a neighboring hivemind species, Beta-7. Our planet’s maintained a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources. (whispering) So be nice!

Beta-7: Unity. [pauses] Is it a… bad time? Are all… present lifeforms… assimilated?

Unity (Man with glasses): Beta-7, this is my single-minded friend from Earth, Rick.

Beta-7: Rick… Sanchez. Unity has spoken of you.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: All bad I hope. [laughing]</speech>

(Rick laughs and puts his hand on the lead Beta-7’s shoulders. All Beta-7 assimilated scream and point at Rick)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Whoa, Jesus Christ!</speech>

Unity (Redhead): Beta-7, if my allies are a problem for you perhaps our alliance is as well.

Beta-7: Our alliance is beneficial. When Beta-7 expresses concern it- it’s only … be-because…

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know what I can make with this stuff?</speech>

Unity (Redhead): Oh… Rick, I- I shouldn’t...

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Come on, it’s not every day that I’m in town! It- it’s for old time’s sake.</speech>

Unity (Redhead): Uh… Okay, what the hell! We can purify the resin and make fractal dust!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but…</speech>

Unity: Aww, old man Rick can’t party with the whole planet?

(Both laugh)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I can do whatever you do and more, baby.</speech>

Beta-7: Hrmm…

(Beta-7 leaves)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical.</speech>

(Both laugh)

[Trans. To Rick’s underground lair. Jerry is searching with a flashlight.]

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill.</speech>

(Both see Blim Blam chained up to a wall and yell)

Blim Blam: [Gurgling]

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Well. Nice. Real nice. Alien prisoners under the house. Real nice. Nice. Reeeal-</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Goddamn it, stop.</speech>

[Trans. to Unity’s planet, Summer is in the street on a soapbox with a megaphone]

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Wake up people! You have to fight it! You’re under the spell of an evil monster!</speech>

Unity (Man with glasses): I can hear you.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Yeah! So you keep saying!</speech>

(She starts slapping the man)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Summer!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there!</speech>

Unity (Steven Phillips): Why do you hate me, Summer?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: I’m not talking to you! I’m talking to…</speech>

(She reaches into his pocket and grabs his wallet, and flips over to his license)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: ...Steven Phillips! Steven! Set yourself free!</speech>

Unity (Steven Phillips): Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: ...Yeah, well so what? At least he was himself.</speech>

Unity (M.Biologist): This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide. Now she’s a marine biologist.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Listen Unity, I don’t think my sister’s trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she’s just saying that life would be… you know, life.</speech>

Unity (Old man): I have transformed life here into a paradise. Prostitutes are now scientists. The homeless are now phisosophers.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh, phi- phisosophers?</speech>

Unity (Old man): Philophiluh… phiphophibup...

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh my god. Where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut?</speech>

Unity (Old man): I’m feeling… urk!

(The man falls down and vomits. All other assimilated in the area follow suit.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh man! Let me help all of you guys up!</speech>

Unity (All): I’m fine!

[Trans. to penis-shaped house. Various assimilated are dancing. Rick is on the couch drinking]

Unity (Administrator): Do you know what I love about you, Rick? You’re the only single mind I’ve met who really sees the big picture.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You got that right. But… baby, listen. Y-you’re talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta… you gotta just… remember to let go sometimes, you know.</speech>

Unity (Administrator): I can let go! Hey, look! You see that town across the river? Watch this.

(Planes fly past and bomb the town, blowing it all up)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Whoa!</speech>

Unity (Administrator): Ha ha! Woot!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Whoa! That’s not what I meant!</speech>

Unity (Administrator): [laughing] It’s okay! It’s okay, I evacuated! I evacuated the town, look!

Unity (Townspeople): Hey! Right here! We’re fine!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: [laughing] Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren’t in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? … H-hey, my drink is empty.</speech>

[Trans. to street. More assimilated are dancing, though they’re falling over and puking. Vehicles crash. Morty and Summer are running and almost get crushed by falling beams.]

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty and Summer: Aah!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Unity, what’s happening?</speech>

Steven Phillips: Who’s Unity? You kids have nice feet. Mind if I take a picture?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Gross, no!</speech>

(He takes a picture anyway and wanders off)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I think you’re getting what you wanted, Summer. Something’s happening to Unity.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Do… all of you remember who you are?</speech>

Ron Benson: ...Yeah. My name is Ron Benson. I’m… an electrical engineer. Father of two, and as you can see from my flat concentric nipple rings, I’m a member of this planet’s top race! [opens shirt to reveal ring nipples]

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Okay, that’s good! Uh… Don’t focus too much on the last part, but...</speech>

Daryl Jefferson: I’m Daryll Jefferson. I’m a landscaper. And I’ll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch’s race is superior! [removes shirt] The cone-nipple people will rule this world!

Ron Benson: You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards!

Daryl Jefferson: What’d you say to me, you target-chested piece of shit?

Alien man: Race war!

(The crowd breaks out into fighting)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Why are you fighting? Can’t you see you’re all the same?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Ah, Summer. Ha ha. First race war, huh?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Way to go, Summer. You started a race war.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: I didn’t start it! They’re the racists! I… I  merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Okay, thanks for clarifying! Y- I’ll have a super accurate headstone now!</speech>

Rioter: Hey wait, what race are you guys?

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: [pulling up shirt] We’re neither! S-see?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Yeah, take my word for it. We just have regular nipples.</speech>

Rioter: Hey! These two freaks have no race!

(Morty and Summer run, and get chased by a gang of rioters, before getting cornered against a wall)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh, there’s no place like home! There’s no place like home! Remember, Summer?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh…</speech>

(The two hug)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: O-oh, yes, yes yes…</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: All the tiny people?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Dorothy, take us away! Take us away!</speech>

(As the rioters get closer, Unity (SWAT) drops in and surrounds the two, pushing the rioters back. An assimilated drops down and pulls the two into a hovercopter)

Unity (SWAT): Hello Summer. Hello Morty.

Unity (Pilot): It’s okay! You’re safe now.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: U-Unity?</speech>

Unity (SWAT): Yes.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh, Unity I am so sorry. I didn’t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks! I was thinking more of… a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing.</speech>

Unity (Pilot): Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong! I’m having fun with your grandpa! Lost a little control. Probably shouldn’t be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be… running two hundred thousand pediatric hospitals and twelve million deep friers, but hey! It’s not like this planet can take its business elsewhere!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Um… should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or…?</speech>

Unity (Pilot): No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn’t have gotten drunk! Wooohoooo!

[Trans. to Rick’s underground lair. Blim Blam is chained up, Beth and Jerry are arguing]

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh man. I cannot wait. I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this. He is gone!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Jerry, stop! Please, okay, we weren’t even supposed to be down here. If we confront him about this-</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh my god! I love this! I love that this is how far you will go for him. You wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person! Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing! It’s a monster! He might have it chained up so that it doesn’t eat the planet!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Right, because your father’s such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for humans! He’s probably harvesting this creature’s organs!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: He’s probably racing to cure its space aids!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: He’s going to eat it!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: He’s protecting it!</speech>

Blim Blam: [Gurgles]

Both: Shut up!

[Trans. to penis-shaped house, now on fire. Summer and Morty enter.]

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Unity! This place is a mess!</speech>

Unity (Administrator): Oh, it’s cool! The part of me that’s the cleaning lady is coming on Friday. [gasps] Oh my god! I have a meeting at the galactic federation in an hour. Oh, I’ll never make it! Ah, I’ll push it to next week.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Unity, could you get Rick out here please?</speech>

Unity (Administrator): He’s… unavailable! He’s-

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Having sex with you, we get it! Gross. Get him out here now.</speech>

Unity (Administrator): I don’t think he wants to be-

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: (shouting) Grandpa Rick!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: (shouting) Rick! Rick!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: (shouting) I’m gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage!</speech>

(Rick stumbles out, topless, wearing an ammunition belt, a mexican hat and pants, a fake moustache and clutching a bottle of beer)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What the hell… is your problem?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Grandpa, we need to go home! Now!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Fine, geez!</speech>

(He opens a portal)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: See ya!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Uh, Rick? I think we should all go.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Tend your garden, kids, I’m kinda doing a thing here.</speech>

(He puts his arms around two assimilated, who cheer and laugh)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Grandpa Rick, we’re not leaving without you!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh my god [belches] you guys I get it. You’re afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Actually, no. I think Unity’s great and you’re a horrible influence on it!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: This isn’t healthy, Rick! Y- you know you-you’re really up to no good around here. I-at-at this place,  you know?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: You and Unity are like… like… leggings and mid-calf boots. You think you’re great together but you’re just bringing out the worst in each other!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don’t we see what Unity thinks. Unity?</speech>

Unity (Shades guy): I’m just taking a little break from stuff. You know? I need to relax.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, hey, wh-what’s this on the news, guys? L-l-let me turn it up.</speech>

Unity (Todd): In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is. We’re… really just having a good time. Karen?

Unity (Karen): Thanks, Todd. Up next: Are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill? We’ll tell you how you can really know for sure!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I think you two are a little outnumbered.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Okay! Well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favour to us… because you love us?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What? Dumb. Bye.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: But Rick, Summer’s just-</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Summer’s just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what’s the word I’m looking for here… uh- human! It runs in the family! I can tolerate it but I can’t give a crap about it. Take a hike.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Take care of yourself, Unity.</speech>

(Summer and Morty leave through the portal)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I’m not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?</speech>

[Trans. back to Beth and Jerry]

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: You’re the worst!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: No! You’re the worst! You don’t support this family!</speech>

(The two start yelling over the top of one another)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: All you care about is yourself!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: You think supporting the family is about supporting you emotionally...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: You’ve got two children being dragged across the cosmos...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: ...but you’re unsupportable! Because it’s never enough, Jerry!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: ...by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: It will never be enough support to satisfy you! And you don’t even know what it’s like…</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Because you’d rather lose them and lose me than lose him!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: …to be afraid of losing anything because you cling and you cling and you cling…</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: And why? Because you’re the child, Beth. You, not me, you!</speech>

(Blim Blam gurgles angrily and breaks free)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Aaah!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh my god!</speech>

(Both back away. Jerry puts his arm protectively in front of Beth. Blim Blam moves past them and breaks into a cabinet, before pulling out an object and pointing it at the two like a gun)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth and Jerry: Aah!</speech>

(Blim Blam pushes the object into his neck)

Blim Blam: Um, first of all, hello. Uh, my name is Blim Blam the korblok. Second of all, cards on the table: I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies. However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that I suppose you could call ‘space aids’ as you put it, and Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. At the same time, Rick’s motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else’s, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks. But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I’m never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the fucking worst! You both hate yourselves and each other! And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable! I’d laugh but I’m biologically incapable, that’s how alien I am! And even I’m sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck! So! Good luck with your shitty marriage, and I’m sorry that Rick has to deal with either of you. Blim Blam, out!

(He drops the translator and leaves, but quickly rushes back to pick it up again)

Blim Blam: You know what? I’m taking this.

[Trans. to garage. Summer and Morty have returned. Blim Blam pushes at the garage door but can’t open it]

Blim Blam: How do you- what is this?

(Morty activates the garage door opener)

Blim Blam: Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever.

(He leaves, flipping the two off with a penis-shaped finger)

[Trans. to Rick, who’s on the couch watching TV surrounded by several assimilated]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Aaah! [coughs] Okay, okay, now make him cry. But happy cry. Now make ‘em all make fun of the blonde one. Now make ‘em all do it on the table! I can’t believe you created a whole show for me. Now cancel it! Okay, now put it back on. Haha! [pauses] Alright, I’m bored.</speech>

Unity (Administrator): Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty? I feel bad that they-

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I’ll be right back. Don’t waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They’re no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you’re powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?</speech>

Unity (all): Never.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Never! Back in a flash.</speech>

(Rick goes into the bathroom, and washes his hands and face)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let’s see how long we can go!</speech>

(He goes back into the main room. Unity has disappeared, but there are letters everywhere)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey Une! You got any more-</speech>

(He picks up a note and reads it. Unity talks in a voiceover, using the voices of different assimilated for each part)

Unity (voiceover): Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I’m not strong enough to do it in persons.

(Rick starts wandering around town. The entire town is fil'led with letters. He picks up to read some as he goes)

Unity (voiceover): I realise now that I’m attracted to you for the same reason I can’t be with you. You can’t change. And I have no problem with that, but… it clearly means I have a problem with myself.

Unity (voiceover): I’m sure there’s no perfect version of me. I’m sure I’ll just unify species after species and never really be complete.

Unity (voiceover): But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way you’re better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else’s, Unity. P.S. I don’t know where those coal miners were before they got assimilated. You might want to get checked.

[Trans. to the Smiths watching TV in the living room. Rick enters from the left]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Dad… [clears throat] I… um… Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair… and your alien prisoner. And… he got away. And I know I sound like mom but I can’t sacrifice this whole family’s safety just because I’m afraid you’ll leave again, so no more alien prisoners, and, no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Okay.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: ...Okay? Y-y-y-y-Okay like you’re gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No. It’s your house.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Grandpa Rick! What happened… with Unity?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we’re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It’s not cool. Fun’s fun but who needs it? I’ll be in the garage.</speech>

(“Do you feel it?” by Chaos Chaos starts playing in the background. Rick enters the garage, looking depressed, and drains his flask before throwing it away. Then he pulls out two bulbs and puts together a metal contraption on the desk. He pulls a frozen alien creature out of the drawers and brings it to life with a flask of chemicals, strokes it while it shrieks helplessly, and drinks the rest of the chemicals. He puts one of the bulbs into the contraption and sticks the alien under it, disintegrating it with a blast of energy, then replaces the bulb and repeats the process with his own head. At the last second, he falls unconscious, dodging the killing blast. The screen zooms out through the open garage door, showing Rick slumped still on the desk through the night and into the morning, even as Jerry shows up, happily weeding the garden and the driveway without noticing Rick.)

Beta-7: You’re classified as a hostile entity, and Unity doesn’t want to talk to you.

Uncle Steve: Look out world, the Smith family is goin' to Paris!

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer:(Offscreen) Yeah! Awesome!</speech>

(Rick enters the room, and dumps some very familiar-looking rocks into the kitchen trash)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I, you know what, I-</speech>

Uncle Steve: You're gonna land on your feet Jer. Some company out there's gonna think they're lucky stars they hired my little brother.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Who the fuck are you?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: My goofy brother Steve. He's been living here almost a year now, are you losing your mind?</speech>

Uncle Steve: Hey someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks am I right? (Everybody except Rick laughs, Rick shoots Steve in the head)

All except Rick: *unintelegable screaming*

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What the hell, Rick? What the hell?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve". That is an alien parasite.</speech>

(Uncle Steve turns back into his true form and dies)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: But I've known him my whole life!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No you haven't Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Steve wasn't real?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Someone?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Get off the high road Summer, we all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No, "Steve" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.</speech>

Mr. Poopybutthole: Oh wee, whatever you want Rick, we're here to help!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.</speech>

*theme song plays*

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.</speech>

Mr. Poopybutthole: Maybe you got the first one in time Rick!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Can't afford to chance it.</speech>

(Rick presses a button on his watch, all doors and windows in the house are sealed off by blast shields)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Dad, why does our house have blast shields?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Trust me Beth you don't wanna know how many answers that question has.</speech>

Poopybutthole: Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y-- remember that? After "the hulk" musical? (Flashback, Jerry grunting, muzak playing )

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Why couldn't I bring my portal gun? (Morty winces )</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the hulk. I just got that.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose.</speech>

Poopybutthole: Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine. I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be. ( chuckles )

Nicky: somebody call for repairs?

All: Yay! Cousin Nicky!

Nicky: It's me, cousin Nicky. I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not. I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here! ( laughter ) (Cut back to the present) It's true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let's get some fresh air.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things.</speech>

Nicky: I hear you, Morty. Back in brooklyn, we got a sayin' -- "we're walkin' here!" ( laughter )

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Nicky! (Rick shoots Nicky in the shoulder, and he reverts back into a parasite)</speech>

Nicky: Oh! ( gasps ) ( groaning )

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: But how did you know it was Nicky?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine. Did that not even happen?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Well, of course it happened.</speech>

(Flashback, Morty, Rick, Jerry, Beth and Nicky are tied up, a Nazi stands before them)

Nazi: Now that I possess the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the fourth reich!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.</speech>

Nicky: Hey, we got a word for nazis back in Brooklyn, pal.

Nazi: I'm comfortable being called a nazi. You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings? (Hits Nicky on the head) Yeah. Think before you talk shit. Rah-gubaba, help me kill america! (Mr. Beauregard knocks out the nazi)

All: Mr. Beauregard!

Mr. Beauregard: After due consideration, I have elected not to retire.

All: Yeah! Oh, thank god!

Mr. Beauregard: Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty's high school. (Return to the present) Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler. ( chuckles ) dare to dream.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wait.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble. ( laughter )</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No! Don't flashback!</speech>

(Flashbacks, Jerry has his head stuck in the staircase railing)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: You're just gonna make more swelling.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Don't worry, Jerry. Just relax. We called the fire department.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: You know they won't come here anymore. ( grunting ) (Mr. Beauregard pours marmalade on Jerry, all gasp )</speech>

Mr. Beauregard: Marmalade is served. (everybody cheers)

Frankenstein: I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine. ( laughter )

(Rick, Summer, and Mr. Beauregard are having a pillow fight)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Take that!</speech>

Sleepy Gary: We're trying to sleep.

(Morty is in the living room with Beth, Jerry, and Sleepy Gary)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I don't want to go to the dance alone.</speech>

Mr. Beauregard (Off-screen): Then perhaps, you shouldn't.

(Mr. Beauregard appears, in a dress)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Aww. Mr. Beauregard.</speech>

Mr. Beauregard: Shall we, master Morty?

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: We shall.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh, wait, don't leave without letting photography raptor take a picture. ( raptor screeches ) ( camera shutter clicks ) ( cut back to the present, laughter )</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house.</speech>

But there's always been 10.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites.</speech>

Frankenstein: You sure about that, Rick?

Mr. Beauregard: Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: All right, there's six of us, ( belches ) and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Uh, dad, that's like 10 people.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: 6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?</speech>

Pencilvester: Right here, Rick! Use me!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, thanks, Pencilvester! (writes the number 6 again) Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that.</speech>

Pencilvester: Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these? ( laughter, camera shutter clicks )

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: That's it. Photos. Hard evidence. (Beth scrolls through photos, becomes suspicious) You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole.</speech>

Poopybutthole: Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school. (everybody else stares at Summer) What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're mormon or dying.</speech>

Frankenstein: I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen.

(Flashback)

Tinkles: Summer!

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Tinkles! It's past my bedtime.</speech>

Tinkles: ( giggles ) Not in never past bedtime land! Here we go! ♪ Summer and Tinkles ♪ ♪ friends with each other ♪ ♪ living in never past bedtime land ♪ ♪ no kitchen sinkles ♪ ♪ no little brother ♪ ♪ going to raves and waving our hands ♪ (Rapper rapping ) ♪ Summer and tinkle, friends to the end ♪ ♪ group text the whole crew, my mother... Friends! ♪ ♪ ketchup to the salt, salt to the fry ♪ ♪ "t" to the "inkle" with a capital "I" ♪

(Scene cut's back to Summer's Bedroom, revealing that she was only dreaming)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!</speech>

Gary: Summer, we're trying to sleep.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: It was Tinkles! Tinkes?</speech>

(Cut back to the present)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: That is su-- [belches] -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to –</speech>

Tinkles: Hi, everybody. I'm Tinkles, and these are my friends. ( all sigh )

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: See, everyone? Tinkles is real. That means so am I.</speech>

(Everyone except Rick apologizes to Summer)

Frankenstein: I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the Smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend.</speech>

Sleepy Gary: Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. (Tries to shoot Summer)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Aah! Grandpa Rick!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hold still, "Summer."</speech>

Gary: Rick, that is my daughter.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.</speech>

Sleepy Gary: Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you?</speech>

Hamurai: Rick, you love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai!

Amish Cyborg: Remember it, Rick?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan?</speech>

All: Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue.

( chatter )

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.</speech>

Pencilvester: You're good at it, Rick.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Watch me, baby. I'm like tom cruise from, um, "cuisine" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like tom cruise from "cuisine." ( chuckles ) yeah. Is that what it's called? "cuisine"?</speech>

Pencilvester: Wow! Hey, everybody. Let's give it up for the grill master, Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! ( all chanting "Rick" )

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wait. (cut back to the present, breathing heavily ) Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages.</speech>

Sleepy Gary: I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields?

All: Yeah.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. ( grunts )</speech>

Pencilvester: But Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff.

(Flashback)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition "Zelda" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff.</speech>

(Cut back to the present)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that</speech>

Pencilvester: Don't overreact, Rick.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Sleepy Gary, a word?</speech>

Sleepy Gary: Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He's actually Frankenstein's monster.

(Rick looks at Frankenstein, Frankenstein pounds his fist)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Sleepy Gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then...</speech>

Sleepy Gary: Jerry, just say it.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real?</speech>

Sleepy Gary: Jesus, Jerry. No, you're real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry. Remember our vacation?

(flashback)

Gary: They're filming that new "Star Wars" movie down the coast. Should we check it out?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Sure. Why not? (Gary drinks, Jerry drops his bottle, both he and Gary reach for it)</speech>

Gary: Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I'd like that. ( Kissing ) What are we doing?</speech>

(Cut back to the present)

Gerry: I don't give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house.</speech>

(Transit to the living room, Rick is pointing the gun at random people)

Frankenstein: That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Uh, no thank -- ( grunts ) Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?</speech>

Frankenstein: Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam.

(Flashback)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?</speech>

Frankenstein: Shi-i-i-i-t. I'mma bust a -- ( cut back to the present, Rick grunts )

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein! ( indistinct shouting ) Give it back!</speech>

All: Yeah! ( applause ) Frankenstein!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: ( breathing heavily ) Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!</speech>

Reverse Giraffe: Maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real. You know me. I'm reverse giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with Hamurai.

Hamurai: Hai!

Reverse Giraffe: I saved Ghost In A Jar's life in Vietnam.

Ghost in a Jar: Boo rah!

Reverse Giraffe: And Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on?

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: ( sighs ) Too many.</speech>

Reverse Giraffe: Okay, so maybe we're just all fake.

Mrs. Refrigerator: That don't make no sense!

Reverse: Giraffe: Or maybe, there's only one deceiver here -- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!</speech>

Reverse Giraffe: I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.</speech>

(Flashback)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls! ( laughs ) yeah! Say that all the time.</speech>

(cut back to the present) All: ( muttering ) That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: And don't forget his incredibly vague back story.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Beth, I'm your father!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh, are you, dad? Are you?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?</speech>

(Everybody is surprised)

Mrs. Refrigerator: In your face!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Give me the gun. (Looks at everyone else) I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage. ( all cheering ) All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh -- oh, yeah?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, mother[bleep] Pull the [bleep] trigger!</speech>

(Morty shoots Baby Wizard, Baby Wizard screeches )

Duck with Muscles: Oh, wow. Baby Wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife. (Morty shoots the duck, parasite screeches )

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What the hell?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!</speech>

(Flashbacks of times where Rick left Morty in depair) ♪ these memories that we have ♪ ♪ these memories that we cherish ♪ ♪ I wish that we... can go back... to that time ♪ ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

(Cut back to the present)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Holy crap, Morty, you're right.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough. (Rick turns the dial on the washing machine, the wall draws back to reveal a set of guns)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. ( grunts )</speech>

(Rick shoots a parasite, everybody else screams )

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?</speech>

Mrs Refrigerator: I-I-I-I -- everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time? (flashback, Beth, Jerry, Mrs. Refrigerator and a lot of other people on a roller coaster, screaming, cut back to the present) Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, Mrs. Refrigerator. They're thrilling. And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life.</speech>

Mrs Refrigerator: The jig is up! ( whimpering ) get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah! ( screeching ) ( all gasping ) Oh [bleep]

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Why am I always your go-to?</speech>

(Flashback, Morty is hosing the backyard, Summer grunts and kicks him in the crotch, Morty whimpers )

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Never go in my room again.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I didn't! (Cut back to the present) She's real. She's my bitch of a sister.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Nice. (Flashback) Mom, are you driving me to --</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh, my god. Are you drunk?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: ( belches ) * slurring * What're you, my life coach?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Your what? Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh! God! Mom!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Sweetheart, are you okay? I didn't mean to --</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: I'm gonna have a bruise! It's picture day!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: It's not, don't overreact. I can clean it up.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: ( sobs ) I want the police to take me!</speech>

(Cut back to the present)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Thank you, sweetie.</speech>

Cross Teddy Bear: Beth, Beth, please!

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I thought it was too good to be true that we'd have compatible kidneys. (shoots the bear, parasite screeches ) ( guns cock ) ( screaming ) ( blasting ) ( screeching )</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: (Corners Pencilvester) Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.</speech>

Pencilvester: Rick, I'm Pencilvester. Listen to that name. You can't kill me.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You're right. (To Morty) Kill Pencilvester.</speech>

(Morty shoots Pencilvester, parasite screeches ) (Summer shoots Frankenstein, parasite screeches ) (Summer shooting, parasites screeching )

Tinkles: Summer, I've always loved you!

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Yep. (Shoots Tinkles, parasite screeches ) ( all gasp, Summer shoots ) ( more screeching ) (Morty shouts)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh, my god!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I-I-I thought you went to a concert!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?!</speech>

Mr. Beauregard: Ah. Master Rick. Remember when you weren't going to shoot me? (Rick shoots Mr. Beauregard, parasite screeches )

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?</speech>

Ghost in a Jar: Oh, I-I get it. It's a play on "the butler did it."

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy. (shoots ghost in a jar, parasite screeches ) ( screeches )</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.</speech>

Sleepy Gary: Don't worry. I have a plan. If we can get to my boat, there's a -- (Beth shoots Sleepy Gary, Gary slowly turns back into a parasite, screeches )

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: (tries to kiss Beth)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Me, too. ( Rick opens the blast shields )</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: This is depressing. We killed every good person in the house. We're what's left? What a family.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Ricky ticky tavi!</speech>

Mr. Poopybutthole: Ooh, whee! Amen to that. Now, this little poopypants is hungry. Will somebody pass me a pork chop? ( chomping )

Mr. Poopybutthole: Huh. I-is -- is something wrong, Beth? (Beth shoots Mr. Poopybutthole) Ow! ( screams ) oh, my god!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No, Beth! Oh [bleep]</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Wait, but I --</speech>

Mr. Poopybutthole: Oh, Beth! Why?!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I need an ambulance! There's been a shooting. My wife shot... Uh, my -- my wife shot a long-time family friend.</speech>

Mr. Poopybutthole: Why?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I-I thought --</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Keep breathing!</speech>

Mr. Poopybutthole: Oh, god. What's happening?

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Look at me! Look at me! Don't -- don't fall asleep!</speech>

Poopybutthole: Is -- is this what bleeding to death is? Oh, whee. Is this how I die?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, geez! Oh, my god!</speech>

Mr. Poopybutthole: Why would you do this? Beth. It's not supposed to hurt. I-I thought... ( siren wails ) Ooh, whee.

(Post-Credits scene)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh, he -- he's looking a lot better.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Is, um, is he mad at me?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the "you shot me" equivalent of not being mad.</speech>

(Doctor steps out of the room)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Can he have visitors?</speech>

Doctor: He'd like to be alone. He told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him? If you love him, you should leave. ( door closes )

(Smith family walks out of the hospital)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: (Smiles) And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.</speech>


EPISODE 5
<title>Get Schwifty</title> <airdate date="8/23/2015"></airdate>

(A giant yellow head flies through space toward Earth. The Earth catches fire and land masses start collapsing as the wind picks up.)

(A man takes a golf swing in the middle of the storm. A large piece of land drops out in front of him, leaving a large hole.)

Man: Hey, golf is easy now!

(The hole gets larger and the man falls in.)

Man: Aahh! Golf is hard again! Golf is hard agaaaaaaain!

(A news anchor in a raincoat, Terry, is downtown with people panicking in the background as the giant head stares blankly at Earth. A news title says “ArmagHEADdon?!”.)

Terry: The view here is the same as yours, Jim. A giant head has entered Earth’s gravity, triggering climate change and natural disasters we thought were impossible for at least another eight years.

Jim: (in news studio) Let’s not make this political, Terry. Do we know what this giant head wants?

(Giant Head clears its throat, creating a large wind blast)

Giant Head: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

(winds pick up and the tides change rapidly with its speech)

Terry: Jim, you heard *static* said, “Show me what you got.”

Giant Head: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GOT. (lamp post falls over, Terry runs out of frame)

(Rick turns off the TV, they are on the couch)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Uhh, where?</speech>

(Rick puts on sunglasses)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon. *burp* The lame one, here on Earth.</speech>

(Rick and Morty walk out of frame)

[INTRO]

(At the house, winds still blow strongly. Summer, Beth and Jerry are standing outside.)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Is it God? If it’s God, do we get out of school?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: It’s not God, Summer.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Shut up, Jerry.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Ok…</speech>

(Rick and Morty pull out of the garage in the ship.)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Dad, what do you know about this?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.</speech>

(they fly off)

(Mr. Goldenfold arrives on a moped.)

Mr. Goldenfold: Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi, I’m Morty’s math teacher. I’m also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: How is praying going to help?</speech>

Mr. Goldenfold: Ma’am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers? Let’s be rational! I’ll see you at God’s house! (leaves)

(Pentagon war room, everyone is arguing)

President: Gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! Simon?

Simon: SETI, NORAD, and every broadcaster on the planet are attempting to show this being what humanity’s got. String theory, world history, the human genome.

(Nathan slams fist on table)

Nathan: Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America’s got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating head’s ass!

(Argument begins again. A portal appears and Rick and Morty step through.)

Guards: Hold it! Don’t move! (they approach Rick and Morty with guns)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!</speech>

(Guards stop and look at Nathan for approval. Nathan nods at them, and the guards aim. A laser fires at the guards and they disappear, leaving only snakes.)

President: Stand down. Everybody stand down! I’m the leader of these people and I’m unarmed. There’s no need for any more snake-makery.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty. (drinks from flask)</speech>

Everyone: Hi, Morty.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Hey.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math. (points to viewscreen showing floating head) This head won’t go away until *burp* Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.</speech>

Everyone: Seriously, that’s impossible, etc…

Simon: You mean like Vivaldi?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.</speech>

President: All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream. (no one responds) The-Dream? He wrote “Umbrella” and “Single Ladies”? You people haven’t heard of The-Dream?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.</speech>

Nathan: How do you know about that?

President: For God’s sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps.

Aide: Sir! Pharrell, Newman, Corgan, and that Dream guy. They’re all dead.

President: What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them?

Aide: The Grammys, sir. There was an earthquake and all the musicians... (sniffs, holding back tears) All the famous ones, they’re gone.

President: Dear God.

Aide: Hold on, sir, just a minute. Ice-T survived. He’s inbound on an F-15, ETA two hours.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Good luck, Mr. President.</speech>

Simon: Sir, the magnetic poles are about to reverse. In two hours, there may not be an Earth to save.

(Rick opens a portal)

President: Sanchez! Are you a musician?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I dabble, Mr. President.</speech>

President: Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.

(At the church, everyone is panicking.)

Father Bob: People! Everyone! Remain calm! Every crisis of faith is an opportunity for more faith! When God deals you an 11, you don’t fold! You double down, and always hit on a soft 16. That means you, Jews.

Jew: I beg your pardon, pastor, but the last I looked outside, it seems to be you that’s been dealt the weak hand. Jews rule! (no one responds) Nobody? Ok, tough church.

Principal Vagina: Hi, Principal Vagina. The name’s real, possibly Scandinavian. I’m just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. F*** all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky.

(everyone reacts)

Principal Vagina: Ah, di di di di. (to Bob) Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this (holds up a necklace with a cross) can beat that… what have you done for me lately? (tosses necklace to Bob) So if you wanna excuse me, I’m going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the f***ing weather! (walks out) Outta my way!

Pastor Bob: Ok, if sanity’s been restored to this assembly, I’d like to talk about the cost of repairing our new organ. Sally, the plate, please.

Mr. Goldenfold: (holds up a dollar) Ohhhh, this is my favorite part!

(Helicopters over the desert, subtitle “Nevada Desert: Restricted Air Space”. Rick and Morty are on a helicopter)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick, are you really a musician?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Me!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah, not with that attitude.</speech>

Jump Master: We’re in the drop zone! I’m the jump master! My name’s Jamey! With an E-Y! Go, go, go! (Rick slides down rope)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: B-b-but we don’t have a song!</speech>

(Outside the church, Principal Vagina is on the sidewalk on his knees)

Principal Vagina: Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we’ve done. We’re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone.

(At Area 51 speaker system, Rick and Morty slide down rope out of helicopter)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick and Morty: WhooooOOOOAHHHH!!!!</speech>

(They land on a stage with various live performance equipment on it. The yellow Cromulon is in front of the stage staring.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: (picks up a microphone) All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh man, ok, all right, um…</speech>

(Morty presses a key and a beat starts, Rick knocks over a mic stand and starts “singing”)


<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ahhhhh yeahhhhh</speech>

Ya gotta get schwifty

(Morty starts beating a tambourine in rhythm)

Ya gotta get schwifty in here

It’s time to get schwifty


(The President and Nathan are watching the performance on a screen inside)

Nathan: Get… schwifty? What the hell is that?

President: It’s our world’s best effort, that’s what.


<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Take off your pants and your panties</speech>

Shit on the floor

Time to get schwifty in here

I’m Mr. Bulldops


Nathan: Mr. Bulldops?

President: Don’t analyze it, Nathan. It’s working!


<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Take a shit on the floor</speech>

Time to get schwifty in here


(Weather starts to die down around the world)

(At the church)

Pastor Bob: And third-level donors get our all access family pass.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Listen! The storm is stopping!</speech>

(On the stage)


<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey, take your pants off</speech>

It’s schwifty time today

(song ends)


Giant Head: Hmmmm.

(everyone at Area 51 waits in anticipation)

(at the church)

Principal Vagina: Please be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground.

(at the stage)

Giant Head: I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT. GOOD JOB.

(Giant Head flies away)

(everyone at Area 51 cheers and celebrates)

(at the church, everyone lifts Principal Vagina, “What do you know, he was right! Hooray Principal Vagina!”)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Now hold on a second, let’s be rational about this.</speech>

(everyone stops and stares at Beth)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: No, I’m… I’m just saying, we don’t know if there’s a cause-effect relationship --</speech>

(earthquake hits, Beth falls on ground)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh, God, what’s going on now?</speech>

(at the stage, Rick and Morty and Area 51 panic)

(The Earth is surrounded by an energy field and disappears. Earth reappears in another galaxy with four other planets, a disco ball-like sun, and several different-colored Cromulons looking at Earth.)

(At Area 51)

President: What the hell happened?

Aide: Mr. President, you’re gonna wanna see this.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I think planet Earth has just been transported.</speech>

(At the church)

Principal Vagina: The head has left and sent its children!

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Holy CRAP!</speech>

(everyone gets on their knees)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!</speech>

(everyone starts murmuring prayers)

(At Area 51)

Simon: Sir, we’ve started picking up on a garbled signal. We’re decrypting it now.

(screen gradually descrambles)

(Screen shows different bands of different aliens on different stages. Dance music plays in the background as the Cromulon narrates.)

Cromulon: WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE’LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.</speech>


ACT 2

(dance music plays, Planet Music opening shows)

Cromulon: Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, let’s hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

Greebybobe: Hold it, hold it, stop! Music isn’t about competition or captivity! If you love music, you love freedom. Let these worlds be free, please!

Cromulon: DISQUALIFIED!

(plasma ray powers up and fires at the planet, blowing it up)

Cromulon: There’s one every season. Moving on to planet Arbolez Meterosos. Arbolian Meterososians. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.

Arbolian Meterososian: Ah two, three, four…

(The Arbolian Meterososians play a very simple and underwhelming song while looking at the Cromulons for approval.)

(At Area 51. Rick, Morty and Ice-T are in a studio with several instruments. Rick is playing a bass, Morty is poking at a keyboard, and Ice-T is in the corner. The aide comes in.)

Aide: Rick, Morty, Ice-T. The timetable’s moved up. Earth’s on in six hours.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Like we’re not already under enough pressure! (Morty flips a bowl of peanuts at the aide and it hits him in the head. The aide leaves.)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick and Ice-T: Whoa ho ho ho ho!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Genius happens in the moment, Morty. (walks over to keyboard)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning. (presses a button on the keyboard) Balls.</speech>

(Morty walks toward the portal gun)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What?!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah, *burp* you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities, *burp* Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey, Morty! Could you lick my… (Rick presses keys on the keyboard with the sample of him saying “Balls”)</speech>

(The President, Nathan, and his aide are watching them through a window)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick!</speech>

Nathan: I’ve seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.

President: And what’s your plan, General?

Nathan: We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky.

President: Our planet’s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I’ll put mine in Rick and Morty. “Get Schwifty” was a jam.

(in field outside church, everyone is dressed in robes wearing head hats. Principal Vagina is holding a homemade satellite on a stick with an earbud)

Principal Vagina: Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he’s proud of what we’re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!

All: Happy Ascension!

(Jerry is holding an ice cream cone, Beth looks unimpressed.)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: We should pack up and leave town now.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.</speech>

(Summer arrives wearing a head hat, holding two head hats. Beth double-facepalms.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Here’s yours! (puts hat on Jerry) Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Yeah, sure. Wait, what??</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Dinner sounds nice.</speech>

(Ethan arrives.)

Ethan: Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Summer, are you coming to the Ascension?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Father, can we please go to the Ascension?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?</speech>

(Three people are each tied to a bunch of balloons, tethered to a stake in the ground. One is labeled “Thief”, another labeled “Goth”, and the third labeled “Movie Talker”.)

Principal Vagina: We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies! (cuts first rope) Headward, free now to rise. (cuts second rope) Headward, free now to rise. (cuts third rope) Headward, free now to rise.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!</speech>

(in the studio)

Ice-T: A squeegee comes up from the garage, right? And he’s got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. He’s like, “I’m ready!”

(Rick and Ice-T laugh)

Ice-T: Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3?

(Rick and Ice-T laugh)

Ice-T: Aw, damn. We’re out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!</speech>

(Rick grabs the portal gun, hits a couple buttons, makes a portal in the floor and drops through it. Another portal appears in the ceiling and Rick drops out of it with several snacks.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What?!</speech>

Ice-T: Damn. You didn’t tell me you f*** around with portals and shit.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: That’s it!</speech>

(Morty grabs the portal gun and gets up.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.</speech>

(Morty turns to a wall and fires a portal.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Nooooo!</speech>

(Morty jumps through the portal and Rick tries to grab him, but the portal closes.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ahhhh, sh**!</speech>

President: Ah, sh**.

(Morty steps through different portals to different worlds, ending up in Buttworld.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Ahhh, sh**.</speech>

(Outside of the Smiths’ home, Summer, Beth and Jerry are hoeing the front yard.)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry and Beth: Praise be the…</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Yeah.</speech>

(Principal Vagina arrives on a bicycle with a seat, bell ringing.)

Principal Vagina: Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. It’s 6 p.m., so if you’re a parent, you’re now entitled to adoration from your children.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: I’m going to start dinner! (walks into the house)</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I don’t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: She’s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.</speech>

(Someone tied to balloons floats by in the background with label “Inappropriate Joke Teller”.)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: She’s not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew…</speech>

Balloon Man: Please help me! You can reach me if you try. Please help me!!

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: That’s not our business as long as Summer is thriving!</speech>

(Inside the Smiths’ house, Summer serves dinner at the table.)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Taco time! (Summer pulls off the lid to reveal exactly 12 tacos.) I hope it pleases you as the head desires.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: That’s wonderful, Summer!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: We’re so proud of you. But honestly, you don’t have to make dinner every night.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Of course I do, silly! (gasps and drops lid) Oh my God, daddy, I’m sorry I called you silly! I’m so sorry! (turns around and drops to knees) Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!</speech>

(Summer sulks out of the dining room and up the stairs.)

(Morty stumbles out of a portal on a green world and collapses to the ground holding the portal gun. A figure looms over Morty, pokes him with a stick, then rolls him over.)

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: Morty.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Birdperson?</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing.</speech>

(In the studio, Rick plays with the keyboard and Ice-T is in the corner on his phone.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.</speech>

Ice-T: Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?</speech>

Ice-T: Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I can’t afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what I’m sayin’?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but *burp* if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.</speech>

Ice-T: Pfff. I ain’t worried about no Earth blowin’ up, man.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What? Why not?</speech>

Ice-T: Yo, this is why.

(Ice-T transforms into a floating ice shard with the same face.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What the f***? You can turn into ice?</speech>

Ice-T: My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don’t care if it blows up! Cause I’ll just be ice, floatin’ through space, like a comet!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Take it from me, Ice. *burp* You can’t just *burp* float around space not caring about stuff forever.</speech>

Ice-T: Pshhhh. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick.

(Ice-T blasts out of the ceiling of the studio.)

President: Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to “get schwifty.”

Nathan: Oh, for God’s sake, that’s enough.

(Nathan pulls a gun on the President)

President: What the hell are you doing, Nathan? I’m the goddamn President of the United f***in’ States!

Nathan: I’m setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earth’s performance. And you, Mr. President, I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun!

President: Wait, wait, wait, why-why --

(Nathan pistol-whips the President and he falls to the ground.)

(At Birdperson’s residence, Birdperson serves Morty a bowl of food and tinkers with the portal gun.)

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: I believe I can access the history of Rick’s gun and help you get back to him.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don’t know what humans eat.</speech>

(Tammy arrives wearing a bathrobe.)

<speech designation="extra" character="tammy">Tammy: You know what THIS human eats!</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: Don’t be gross, Tammy.</speech>

<speech designation="extra" character="tammy">Tammy: (leans over to Morty and whispers) Bird… d***.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does.</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I’m alive at all.</speech>

(Birdperson points to a wall of photos of himself and Rick together. Last shown is Rick holding a baby.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What’s that? Who’s that baby?</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson: Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick?</speech>

(Morty stands in thought for a moment. Planet Music starts back up on the TV.)

Cromulon: That was Chunky Tunk with “Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorp Dorp.” Up next, planet Earth!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh God! We’re up?!?!</speech>

(At the church, Principal Vagina and other priests are talking with Jerry and Beth.)

Principal Vagina: Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what Headism has to offer the world.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: The world?</speech>

Principal Vagina: Headism is a hit. We’re taking it worldwide and would like Jerry to be our church’s “Head” of Advertising.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: You… would?</speech>

Principal Vagina: Beth, we’d like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to “Head” of Medicine.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: That’s my dream! That’s my dream.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh… we can’t.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Absolutely not.</speech>

Principal Vagina: I’m sorry?

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: We’ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be “our” daughter, not this person she’s become.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: We’ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion. (turns and puts his hands on Beth’s shoulders) And you know what? I’m sick of pretending that we’re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you’re the love of my life!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: (puts her hands on Jerry’s sides) And I‘m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!</speech>

(Cut: Summer has tied Beth and Jerry to ropes and balloons outside.)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Please don’t do this, please don’t do this! Summer!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don’t know what to do with it and it hurts.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: You’re going to be ok! (ties another balloon to them) You will come back as babies!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I AM a baby! I’m a baby NOW!</speech>

(In the now empty studio, a portal opens up and Morty steps through.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Hello? Is anybody here? (looks through the studio window and sees the President tied up) Mr. President!</speech>

(Morty darts out of the studio to the President and unties him. The President climbs up to the console and presses a button)

President: This is Bluebird. Code tango-niner-alpha. Abort launch. Abort! Hello? (releases button) He’s blocked me out.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!</speech>

President: It won’t matter how schwifty you get, Morty. The General’s got nukes set to launch halfway through Earth’s song!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?</speech>

President: Can the Pope’s d*** fit through a donut?

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Uhhh, I’m not sure?</speech>

President: Exactly!

(On the stage, Rick stands before the Cromulons.)

Cromulon: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Ahem. (starts a low-key, bouncy song) Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.</speech>

(Outside the church, Principal Vagina is preparing to cut Beth and Jerry loose. The Cromulons' faces become angry.)

Principal Vagina: Headward free now to rise!

Mr. Goldenfold: Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin’ angry!

(In the desert, the President flies the helicopter clumsily to the stage with Morty in tow.)

President: I’m really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons on this thing!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a f***!</speech>

(On the stage, Rick continues his song.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd.</speech>

(Outside the church, Principal Vagina is preparing to cut Beth and Jerry loose.)

Principal Vagina: I’m sure that has… that has nothing to do with this.

(Principal Vagina cuts the rope and the Cromulons immediately start booing.)

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: The heads are displeased! (She jumps and grabs Beth and Jerry’s legs.)</speech>

Ethan: Summer! (He jumps and grabs her.)

(On the stage Rick continues his song as the Blackhawk arrives. Morty and the President slide down ropes out of the helicopter onto the stage.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty!</speech>

(The Cromulons begin cheering with “Yay!” and “Hooray!” etc. with smiles on their faces. The now unmanned helicopter crashes off frame.)

(Outside the church, Summer and Ethan are pulling Beth and Jerry down to the ground.)

Mr. Goldenfold: The heads love this! They love it when we DON’T kill the Smith family!

(The balloons are released, but Beth and Jerry are still tied up.)

Principal Vagina: No! Stop that! You’re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!

(On the stage, the President grabs the microphone and speaks to the control room staff.)

President: Call off the nuclear strike! This is the President. Stop the nuclear missile launch!

Nathan: Just launch the missiles!

(Nathan smashes a button and two nuclear missiles emerge from the ground in the desert. The Cromulons watch as the missiles fly toward the yellow Cromulon and lay puny explosions on its chin.)

Cromulon: BOO! NOT COOL!

(Outside the church)

Principal Vagina: I’m the only one that speaks to the heads!

(Cromulon zooms in close to Earth)

Cromulon: DISQUALIFIED!

Mr. Goldenfold: The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!

(The mob runs toward Principal Vagina. The Cromulon zooms closer.)

(On the stage)

Cromulon: DISQUALIFIED! DISQUALIFIED!

(The plasma ray points toward Earth and begins powering up. The control room staff evacuates. The plasma ray heads right for the stage but something flies in the way and blocks it.)

All: Ice-T?

(Ice-T slowly crumbles from the plasma ray’s power)

Ice-T: That’s right, it’s me, Ice-T! I care now! You made me care more! With all due respect, I’d like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: What do you say, Rick?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: I say… (grabs mic) Let’s do it!</speech>

(Morty presses a button on the keyboard and a different beat starts playing. The heads start with “Hooray” etc while smiling. Rick claps over his head and Morty dances a little.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: All right!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Ohhhh yeahhhh!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Come on, here we go!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Ohhhh yeahhhh!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Say it with me!</speech>


All: Head bent over

Raised up posterior

Head bent over (ahh yeah)

Raised up posterior


(Outside the church, Principal Vagina is ties up with balloons and rope. A different person cuts the rope. Vagina sees the heads smiling as he rises.)

Principal Vagina: Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!


(On the stage)

All: Head bent over (yeah)

Raised up posterior (oh yeah)

Head bent over (oh yeah)

(Raised up posterior!)


Cromulon: After 988 seasons of Planet Music, the Cromulons have decided to declare Earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye!

(Earth is transported back to the right place.)

All: Yeah, we did it!

(Outside the church, everyone is still and silent.)

Mr. Goldenfold: Did he just say “musical reality show”?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all.</speech>

(Principal Vagina floats by in the background.)

Principal Vagina: HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: We should go get him.</speech>

(At Area 51, everyone is celebrating. The President shakes hands with Morty.)

President: I hope I can call on you again if we need you, Morty.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?</speech>

(The President waves over Secret Service.)

President: Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we’ll deny it and probably worse.

(A Secret Service agent grabs Morty’s phone and snaps it in half.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Understood.</speech>

(Nathan runs toward them with a gun.)

Nathan: DIIIIEEEE!!!!

(He is hit with an energy blast from Rick and disappears.)

President: Why didn’t he turn into a snake?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.</speech>

(He pulls up his pant leg to reveal a holster which a snake crawls out of. The snake slithers away and a soldier whistles impressed. The President begins laughing and hugs Rick.)

President: I love this man!

[CREDITS]

(On Alphabetrium, Ice-T enters a great hall containing his elders: a grey J, a gaseous F with a female face, and a Q made of lava. All three are holding different scepters.)

Ice-T: Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F. Father.

Magnesium-J: Word of your selfless acts on the Earth planet have travelled across the galaxy.

Ice-T: I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.

Magnesium-J: Very well. Your exile ends today!

(All three press their scepters on the ground and the scepters glow. The beams form another beam that hits Ice-T and transforms him into a letter T made of water.)

Magnesium-J: Welcome home... Water-T.

(The hall shakes and begins falling apart.)

Purple-P: The Numbericons! They’re attacking!

Magnesium-J: Battle stations!

(A piece of the building falls on Magma-Q. Water-T runs over to him.)

Water-T: Father!

Magma-Q: I love you son. I should have never turned you to ice. (He dies.)

(Water-T produces a pistol on each T-end and begins walking out.)

Magnesium-J: Water-T, where are you going? There’s too many of them!

(A dramatic zoom to Water-T’s face.)

Water-T: Then I better crunch the numbers.

(Water-T bursts out of the door shooting at several Numbericons. The frame freezes mid-action and we hear gunshots and screaming. A title appears: “This summer: Water-T And The Rise Of The Numbericons.”)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Oh boy. W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: The battery Morty. Be right back Summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y.</speech>

Man: Hey, excuse me, hello?

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Uhmm...</speech>

Man: What you think you're better than me? Nobody's better than me! Ey! ey!

He is banging on the ship's window; the ship extends an arm from the back and cuts him into cubes with a laser

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Agh! Aghaaaa!</speech>

Ship: Keep. Summer. Safe.

Thinner Man: Hey man, what the hell! That was my daughter's paediatrician! Uagha!

(Jerry pukes.)

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Woahh!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: i know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer in mine.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Not anymore.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You're overreacting!</speech>

Alien Nurse: We're losing him.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Is he going to die?</speech>

Alien Nurse: Don't worry. Dr. Glipglop is the best in the galaxy

Dr. Glipglop: Hello, I'm Dr. Glipglop.

(Jerry pukes a projectile of bile directly at Dr. Glipglop. Dr. Glipglop breaks out into a murderous rage. Rick then disintegrates Dr. Glipglop )

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the gal(Belch)axy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Go in the waiting room, Dad.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Fine! (Transition to the waiting room) Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.(Rick walks up to a TV and smashes the cable box)</speech>

Alien Nurse: Hey! What are you doing!?!

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: A sequel.</speech>

Alien Nurse: I don't understand.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time. (On the TV: Inter-dimensional Cable II)</speech>

(Intro)

(Rick begins to flip through channels while Morty and Summer look very worried)

Randy Dicknose: Man vs. Car. The newest hit show where it pits a man against a car. Tonight's episode Jenkins fights... a regular old car. Here we go. He's pushin' his way through, he's trying to fight that car. The car seems to have the upper hand- Oh, he just got some push-back there.

(The car runs over the man and the tires rip him apart)

Randy Dicknose: Oh, he just got ran over and chewed up by the tires. I guess that's another one for the car. Ha ha ha ha ha... I mean the cars always win.

(Channel changes)

Alien Man: Samantha, I need to know that you understand that I have a couple of eye-holes. (The Alien tears off some skin flaps and reveals some eye-holes)

Samantha: I do, I do understand about your eye-holes! Here, look at my eye-holes! (She tears off her skin flap to reveal many more eye-holes)

Alien Man: Oh, my goodness you have eight eye-holes! (Their eye-holes make contact and start to "kiss") Oh, I'm looking through your eye-holes!

Samantha: Yes, look through my eye-holes!

(The Eye-hole man hovers above the home in a helicopter, then uses a rope to drop into the house)

Eye-hole Man: I'm the Eye-hole Man! I'm the only one whose allowed... to have eye-holes! (He kicks the eye-holes out of the aliens heads) Get on up outta here with my eye-holes!

Announcer: Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the s*** outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Well your thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?</speech>

(Transition to Jerry who is just waking up in his hospital bed)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Where am I?</speech>

Alien Doctor: Relax Mr. Smith, you're in an alien hospital. I mean to you it's an alien hospital, to me you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry Oh, really?</speech>

Alien 1: An hour ago Shrimply Pibbles, the galaxy's most influential civil rights leader, was brought to this hospital's emergency room where he is currently fighting for his life!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: My goodness.</speech>

Alien 1: Mr. Smith, Shrimply Pibble's life can be saved if we replace his heart with your human penis.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: I see-WAIT! What?</speech>

Alien Doctor: It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call "your balls". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a working heart for the most important man in the universe!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Yeah, but, I mean-</speech>

Alien 2: Oh, forget it! I told you this was a waste of time!

Alien 1: Have respect Yarb, the earth man's world is tiny and undeveloped. He knows nothing of the genocides of Klorgon or the tragic events of 6-5.3-4-3-2.2-3-14

Old Alien: And even if he did, he wouldn't comprehend them. I've dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It's funny to say they are small, it's funny to say they are big. I've been at parties, where humans have held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves and called out "hey look at me! I'm Mr. so and so d***." "I've got such and such for a penis." I never saw it fail to get a laugh.

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!</speech>

Alien 1: Then you would give your penis so Shrimply Pibbles may live?

Alien 2: Stop asking!

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Yes I will! That's right, a**holes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!</speech>

(Back to the waiting room where Rick is laughing while evreyone else is stressed)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the s*** all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Morty let's-let's see what else is on.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Okay.</speech>

TV Host: And now we're back to "How Did I Get Here?" The only show that makes you ask "How Did I Get Here?" (Weird laughing from him) Here's our first person!

(It's the Worf lady stuck on top of a light post)

Worf Lady: Oh, oh my goodness! How did I get here? HELLO!?! How did I get here!?! Somebody help me, please!

(Morty looks back where the Worf Lady was and sees that she is not there)

TV Host: Ha ha ha ha, right!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that s*** on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?</speech>

TV Host: How DID she get there? He he (winks at the camera)

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Is that something we should be concerned about?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Just stay away from the coffee machine.</speech>

TV: Calling all Jan-Michael Vincent's, calling all Jan-Michael Vincent's!

Announcer: In a world, where there are eight Jan-Michael Vincent's.

Intercom (TV): We need one Jan-Michael Vincent to quadrant C. Two Jan-Michael Vincent's to quadrant E.

Announcer: And sixteen quadrants. There's only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be in two quadrants at once.

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.</speech>

Announcer: Jan-Michael Vincent's are used up.

(On TV) Radio Control Guy: I need a g*****n Jan-Michael Vincent!

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Nope.</speech>

Alien-Robo Judge: I refuse to sign the legislation that allows more than eight Jan-Michael Vincent's to a precinct.

Announcer: This January, It's time to Mike down your Vincent's. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16.

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick and Morty: Whoa!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: That's Jan-Michaels.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: All right, Morty you've done it!</speech>

(Back to Jerry in the operating room from the view of a woman giving birth)

Alien Doctor: So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here. (The Alien Doctor draws on Jerry with a red marker)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Got it.</speech>

Alien Doctor: Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: (Laughs nervously) Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife.</speech>

Alien Doctor: Oh, do you think she'll be okay with this?

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.</speech>

(Back to the TV)

Stealy: Hey, I'm Stealy. Follow me on my adventure through this office. Alright, here we go. We're gonna just steal a couple of things. (He walks into another room and just starts taking things)

Business Man: Excuse me. Can I help you?

Stealy: Starting with common office objects.

Business Man: Hey, hey, hey! That's my stuff!

Stealy: Such as staplers and pins and all sorts of things like-such as that.

Business Man: That's it. I'm calling security.

(Stealy chloroforms the man, then takes his body with him)

Stealy: All right, okay, we're in the quiet safe room where none of the people whose stuff I stole can get to us. Now, let's look at all the stuff we got. We got a bag of Bobbish. That's eight brapples. We got a plumbus. That's six and a half brapples. We got, uh, a-crushed party cups. Fifteen and a half brapples.

(The show plays a "winner" dinging sound effect) (The TV transitions to a stand up comedy show.)

Comedian: Welcome back to "funny songs". It's all improvised. It's very funny. I need a volunteer from the audience.

A man in the audience: Um, longtime fan of the show. Uh-

Comedian: What do you do? What is your profession?

A man in the audience: I'm a tax attorney.

Comedian: Okay, here we go. Hit-hit the music. (Bad singing): I'm a tax attorney oh, geez, oh forget about everybody else, forget about Budda, forget about Muhammad forget about all those religions! Ba da ba ba da ba bop! The end.

A man in the audience: Oh man. Oh, that was so-so funny. Thank you.

Comedian: You're welcome. Hey, um, security guards, take him out. Get him out of here.

A man in the audience: What?

Comedian: Get the orthodontist out of here.

A man in the audience: No! Why?!?

(The security guards start beating him up)

Comedian: Take him out of the audience. Kill him. Sic him. (A dog runs in and attacks) Demons, suck his life out. I don't give a s***.

Alien Doctor: Smith family?

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Yes?</speech>

Alien Doctor:I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.

All: Yeah, whoo, awesome, called it, that's good news!

Alien Doctor: But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?

(Transition to Jerry's hospital room)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: WHAT!?!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes.</speech>

Alien Doctor: His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?</speech>

Alien Doctor: I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he's gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It's--It's--It's--It's, I mean.</speech>

(She looks at the catalog and gets less and less angry about the idea)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first.</speech>

Alien Doctor: There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. That his fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?</speech>

Alien Doctor: Hundreds of billions.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: Beth, can we talk about this privately?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, "I prefer to keep my penis."</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?</speech>

(She looks at the catalog again, definitely with future plans in mind.)

EPISODE 9
<title>Look Who’s Purging Now</title><airdate date="9/27/2015"></airdate>

    I got to tell you, Rick. It’s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know?
    Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style.
    I agree, Morty. [ Belches ]
    It’s nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year.
    Ohh!
    Relax.
    That’s what windshields are for.
    I didn’t know that there were bugs out in space.
    Well, w-what did you think, Morty?
    Life just developed on earth by itself?
    Here, let me take care of this.
    Geez, Rick, that’s disgusting.
    I don’t want to look at that.
    Yeah, guess I’m out of fluid.
    L-let me find a place to stop.
    Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?
    The general store ought to have what you need. Thanks.
    Of course, you’ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown.
    Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why?
    Sundown is when the festival begins.
    The festival?
    Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace.
    Oh, I know what this is!
    You’ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence.
    That’s right.
    What?!
    It’s like "the purge," Morty. That movie "the purge"?
    Oh, have you been here before?
    No, no, but I’ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick.
    You know, sometimes it’s called the cleansing or the red time.
    There was this one world that called it just murder night.
    I-it’s a purge planet.
    They’re peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge.
    T-that’s horrible!
    Yeah.
    You want to check it out?
    ♪
    [ Electricity crackling ]
    So, what do you do during the festival?
    You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff?
    Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff.
    Oh, I bet you do, old timer. [ Laughs ]
    Gee... Rick, come on. The sun is setting.
    W-we got to get out of here.
    All right, well, w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid?
    It’s on the house. Oh, and, uh, why... why don’t you have some candy bars, as well?
    Oh, no way. That’s really nice of you.
    I’m a nice guy... For now.
    [ Chuckling ] Ohh, I don’t doubt it.
    Rick!
    Yeah, yeah.
    Hey, have a good festival, old timer.
    I intend to.
    Rick, unlock it!
    Just a second, Morty.
    Oh, look at that sunset.
    Stop screwing around.
    [ Click ]
    There we go. Much better. Now we can see.
    Great.
    Hey, you know what, Morty?
    Why don’t we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it?
    What?! No! What is your problem?!
    Morty, grow up. If you don’t want to watch, don’t watch, but, you know, it’s my car.
    [ Belches ] Also, if you tell your mom about this, I’ll purge you.
    You’re the worst.
    And this planet is the worst. How can you be into this?
    You know, people are gonna kill each other.
    So, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that [belches] I-if... if there’s a video online with someone getting decapitated, you don’t click on it?
    No!
    Why... why would I do that?
    You do that?
    I don’t, because it would bore me.
    I see [Bleep] like that for breakfast, Morty.
    But if you don’t do it, I say it’s because you’re afraid of your own primal instincts.
    So you stuff them down and...
    [ Bell chiming ]
    Oh, oh! Shh. Shh. It’s starting.
    Oh-ho-ho! Here we go.
    I’m not watching.
    Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal’s in the mail.
    I’m gonna get a closer look.
    Oh, okay, sure.
    And then someone’s gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we’re gonna crash and we’re gonna be stuck down there and it’s gonna be what we deserve.
    Yawn.
    Whoa! [ Indistinct shouting ]
    Whoa, they are purging the [Bleep] out of each other.
    [ Muffled screaming ]
    Oh, my God!
    Oh [Bleep]
    That was... okay, yeah. T-that was gross.
    Wow. Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, Morty. Ugh.
    My appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick.
    Oh, God. [ Grunts ]
    [ Retching ]
    [ Woman screaming ]
    Get away from me!
    No! No! Help!
    Somebody help me! Aah!
    All right, Morty. L-let’s get out of here.
    Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. W-we have to go down there.
    [ Belching ] What? Why?
    That poor girl. W-we have to save her.
    Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy. We got the wiper fluid.
    We watched them kill each other. We’re leaving.
    Help me save that girl, or I’m telling mom you brought me here.
    You little turd. [ Screaming ]
    Please! Leave me alone!
    Leave you alone? During a purge?
    I don’t think so, baby.
    It’s okay. We’re not gonna hurt you.
    My name is Morty. This is my grandpa.
    We’re tourists.
    Not anymore.
    Aah!
    Aah!
    Oh, my God. This is [Bleep] awesome!
    Morty, this is really cool.
    Hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people?
    It’s fun. We’re totally justified because we’re saving a little girl.
    I mean, w-w-we’re both free and clear to murder these people.
    Are you okay?
    Yes.
    I have to find somewhere to hide.
    Well, you can hide with us. Rick?
    Yeah?
    Do you think we could take... w-what’s your name?
    Arthrisha.
    Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge?
    Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you’ve done to blackmail me?
    Your vehicle... is it from the gods?
    No.
    Yes.
    So, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like, "wait, what?"
    This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?"
    Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it.
    Yeah, I bet. [ Chuckles ] I bet.
    Yeah, it’s kind of like cellphones, you know?
    At first, everyone was like, "look at those douchebags purging," and then the next thing you know, they’re like, "it’s just so convenient."
    Geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, Morty?
    Whatcha doing?
    Watching some TV, playing on your phone?
    Is that a real question?
    Just making conversation.
    Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with?
    My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark "yes" like a trained animal.
    It’s not a conversation.
    You’re holding me verbally hostage.
    Okay, ass-face. I’ll go in the kitchen.
    Hey, dad.
    Yeah?
    Whatcha doing?
    Going into the kitchen?
    Okay.
    Yeah, you like that?
    Screw you.
    So, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge?
    I-I don’t want to answer any more purge questions.
    All right, hey, hey, that’s cool.
    I can roll with that.
    [ Blowing raspberries ]
    [ Gasps ] My Nana!
    Huh?
    My Nana! We have to save her!
    You just now remembered your Nana exists.
    I-I was traumatized.
    Haven’t you been through like 15 purges?
    I mean, some as a child?
    Will somebody just help me get her?
    Fine, whatever. Morty, stay.
    Oh, God. Oh, crap. Oh, crap!
    Get out! Get out!
    Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
    Get the [Bleep] out of the flying machine!
    Oh, my God! O-okay! Okay!
    Back up, asshole.
    [ Whimpers ]
    Back up.
    Ohh.
    Back the [Bleep] up!
    Aah!
    For what it’s worth, I’m sorry, but that’s not really worth anything tonight, is it?
    Y-you can’t leave us here. You’re killing us!
    You hear me? Come back.
    Y-you got to come back. Change your mind.
    Oh, geez.
    Morty! Aah! [Bleep] Amish bitch shot me!
    [ Grunts ] She tried to purge me, Morty.
    You let your wiener do the walking, and now I’m dead.
    Rick, she took the car!
    You [Bleep] kidding me, Morty?!
    She took my car and the gun.
    We’re like the rest of these assholes now.
    W-w-we’re gonna get purged, Morty.
    Help me up.
    Oh, geez, geez! Wait a minute, Rick.
    Why don’t we just use your portal gun?
    It’s in the car, dip-ass.
    [ Grunts ] Oh, God, it hurts.
    She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty.
    It’s the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it. I hope it was worth it.
    I was just trying to do right.
    Yeah, well, that’s not really the theme of tonight’s party.
    Heads up. Rapists.
    Well, don’t just stand there, Morty.
    Purge ‘em.
    Me?
    No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them?
    Pick up a stick or something and kill them.
    Um, w-we come in peace.
    [ Screaming ]
    Oh, my God. [ Grunts ]
    There’s more where that came from!
    You want to get purged, you bring it!
    Drop [Belches] drop your sh1t! Drop it all.
    Morty, go get their sh1t. Hurry up.
    I only had one of those things I threw.
    I’m holding a box of tic tacs right now.
    Want some crackers?
    No, thank you.
    Are you ready to be nice to me?
    In exchange for crackers?
    What happened to you?
    Dad, get a job.
    You’re trying to create drama because you’re bored.
    Oh. [ Beeping, whirring ]
    It’s the space phone grandpa gave us.
    Hello?
    Hey, Summer, it’s grandpa.
    I need you to do me a favor.
    I can barely hear you.
    Who is it?
    Morty and I are on a planet that’s purging.
    I need you to take down...
    A plan that’s what?
    We’re on a planet that’s purging, Summer. Purging.
    We lost our car and my gun, and we’re in a purge.
    Ooh, is it taddi Mason?
    Like the movie "the purge"?
    Yes, I-I need you to take... that movie sucked.
    Oh, my God. Hold on.
    It’s not taddi Mason?
    Dad, who the [Bleep] is taddi Mason?
    My friend.
    Aah!
    Are you okay? I’m putting you on speaker.
    Taddi?
    Yes, Jerry, it’s taddi, a person no one’s ever heard of until now, calling you on a space phone.
    I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic.
    [ Growls ]
    Aah!
    [ Growling ]
    [ Gunshots ]
    Reload, fast.
    Summer, w-we need you to take down this number.
    Quit screwing around.
    Morty? Are you all right?
    No!
    Why are you with taddi Mason?
    Holy [Bleep] dad! Shut the [Bleep] up!
    Okay. I guess I’m just this entire family’s toilet paper.
    Are you writing this down? Will you please write this down?
    Summer: Yes, yes.
    7-7-1-9-8...
    [ Growling ]
    3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5.
    Aah!
    [ Growling ]
    You son of a bitch!
    Morty, I don’t want to be the "a little help" guy, but a little help?
    Aah!
    Okay, I have a pen. Go.
    7-7-1-9-8-3- 6-4-2-1-1-2-5.
    A spoon, Morty?
    A spoon?!
    I’m sorry.
    There’s a pile of silverware next to you, and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything?
    All right, okay!
    Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there’s a red box with a keypad on it.
    You’re gonna take that box outside, and you’re gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad.
    Got it?
    Got it.
    Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad?
    I’m ignoring you.
    Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse, I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package.
    Just remember, if there’s people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first.
    We’re not purging anyone, Rick, all right? W-will you stop it?
    Morty, if we’re gonna survive tonight, you’re gonna need to harness your repressed rage.
    I don’t have any!
    Spoken like a person with repressed rage.
    [ Doorbell rings ]
    I take no part in the festival.
    If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly.
    No such agenda, chief.
    We’re not too keen on the purge, either, sir.
    We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth.
    It’s a different planet.
    By the way, life on other planets exists. Don’t let it distract you.
    I’ll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending on the condition that you listen to my tale.
    Okay.
    Deal.
    All right, I’m gonna go to the roof and set things up.
    Morty, you listen to his tale.
    Okay.
    [ Clears throat ]
    "Fade in. Exterior. Unnamed city. Day."
    The hustle and bustle is a symphony of progress.
    We pan past windows, each of which contain a different story, to find jacey lakims, 28... hot, but doesn’t know it.
    Jacey stops when her high heel gets caught in the grating of a sewer.
    Suddenly, a man steps into frame and points a gun at her.
    This is not her day.
    Fade to black.
    "Title... ‘three weeks earlier.’"
    [ sighs ] You really don’t want to talk to me about this.
    Dad, grandpa and Morty are in danger.
    You’re unemployed, and you’re bored.
    They’re a higher priority.
    Stop saying I’m unemployed!
    Okay, 7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-1
    2... aah!
    Good lord! Now what?
    [ Whirring, humming ]
    Look, I’m your father, and I love you is all I’m saying.
    I’ll leave it at that.
    Fine, dad!
    [ Both scream ]
    Oh, he might have said to take it outside.
    Rick: Come on, Summer.
    How hard is it to type some numbers into a box?
    Target locked. [ Device beeps ]
    Oh, thank God.
    Well, I did my job. Summer did her job.
    Now all Morty has to do is finish listening to that tale.
    "Blane: Maybe I don’t need a new friend."
    Jacey: Maybe you’re the only friend I need.
    Blane: Need, or want?
    Jacey: I’ve never been much for wanting.
    "Blane: Spoken like someone with needs."
    Oh, geez.
    Hmm?
    Uh, sorry. K-keep going.
    "Jacey reaches out and touches his face."
    It’s clear he needs what she wants.
    She’s a woman. He’s a man.
    The city burns in the background as he takes her in his arms.
    Fade out.
    Title... ‘the end’...
    "Question mark."
    Wow.
    Yeah?
    It’s... G-good job. Good job.
    You liked it?
    Of course I did.
    You didn’t laugh at the scene in the bar.
    I...Thought it was funny, but I wanted to hear the rest.
    Do you have any thoughts? Notes?
    No. I-I just enjoyed it.
    That’s my note, you know? Please write more.
    Seems a little insincere.
    What? No.
    You don’t have to mollycoddle me.
    I want to improve my writing. Tell me your real thoughts.
    All right. Well, um, I’m not a huge fan, personally, of the whole "three weeks earlier" teaser thing.
    I feel like, you know, we should start our stories where they begin not start them where they get interest... get out.
    Um, what?
    No, I’m sick of this. You bang on my door, you beg me to help you, I share something personal with you, and you take a giant sh1t on it.
    Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon... well, you can’t. I want you out of here.
    You’re a petty person, and you’re insecure, and you’re taking it out on me. That’s a good script.
    What the hell?!
    I don’t care. I want you out.
    What?
    Take that thing down.
    Your grandson is a shitty person. Leave now.
    Morty!
    Rick, I didn’t do anything.
    I sat through his entire screenplay... you "sat through it"?
    Yes! Did you want me to weep with joy?
    It’s terrible!
    Whoa! Morty! We’re guests here.
    I tried to be a good guest! He dragged it out of me!
    I’m taking down this beacon.
    No, stop! That’s not fair!
    Just because you hate your own writing doesn’t make me a bad person!
    Aah!
    You like that? You want me to cut to three weeks earlier when you were alive?
    Whoa, Morty. You just purged.
    Beacon arriving. [ Device beeps ]
    Okay, time to go.
    Well, terrific.
    [ Sighs ]
    Dad, what’s going on? What’s the deal here?
    I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter.
    You’re growing up so fast.
    You used to be my little girl.
    [ Chuckles ] Yeah.
    Remember when we used to go to the playground, and I’d push you on the swings?
    Oh, you could push me higher than all the other kids.
    You were so small and cute.
    I thought you were gonna fly right off into the street.
    [ Chuckling ] I used to pee my pants.
    I know, and now look at you!
    You have a job. You’re making really good money.
    You’re not paying any rent, so you have plenty of disposable income.
    Oh, God, dad. Please, don’t.
    I just need a few hundred dollars to get through the month. I have some interviews coming up.
    Something’s gonna come through. I can feel it.
    I’m going inside.
    [ Door shuts ]
    [ Sighs ] I guess this is what rock bottom feels like, Jerry.
    Ow!
    It’s okay, Morty. It’s the purge, you know?
    Pushing old lighthouse keepers down the stairs is totally cool.
    It’s not cool, Rick. I-I’m not like these people.
    I can’t run around chopping people’s heads off one day a year and then sleep well the rest of the time.
    Well, you better start getting used to it, little bitch, because we got some [Bleep] company.
    Hey, there he is.
    Here I am.
    [ Beacon whirring ]
    Morty.
    Time to [Belches] purge.

    Hey, thanks for helping me, Rick.
    You’re a pretty great guy.
    Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Bleep] You for shooting my liver.
    I’ll see you around.
    Oh, man. What... what happened?
    Don’t worry about it, Morty.
    Listen, if you wanted to try to get a piece, you better hurry up. Now’s your last chance.
    Hey, hey, arthrisha, um, maybe I could... uh, I have a boyfriend.
    Okay.
    I’m not trying to be rude.
    I just... I don’t want to lead you on.
    I-I-I understand.
    I mean, thank you so much for helping end the festival, but I have a boyfriend, and, uh, he’s just... okay, okay, you can stop saying it.
    I took it okay the first time, and now you’re just repeating stuff.
    Oh, I’m sorry.
    It’s okay.
    Oh, you’re so sweet, I just... oh, but I can’t.
    Yeah, you’re still doing it.
    It won’t be easy creating a new society from the ground up.
    Well, a helpful rule might be if you need something, you get it.
    Pretty simple, right?
    I need food.
    Who’s got food for that guy?
    I do, but this is for me.
    Can’t you make some more?
    Oh, sure. And while I’m making food for everyone, who takes care of my kids?
    I’ll take care of your kids, if I get some extra food for it.
    Extra food?
    Well, I’m not gonna do extra work if we all get the same.
    All right, okay, fair is fair.
    If you do extra work, you get extra food.
    Oh. [ All murmuring ]
    Who’s gonna keep track of who gets how much food for how much work?
    Hello. I can do that.
    I’ll keep track of everyone’s food, you know, in exchange for food.
    That’s not a real job!
    Oh, and making food is?
    You son of a bitch!
    Eat this!
    [ All screaming ]
    Guys, guys, guys, guys, whoa, whoa.
    Cool it, now. Take it easy.
    There’s too much aggression here.
    What if we designate a period of time during which we can all get this hate, murder, and rage out of our system...
    I can’t help but feel ashamed about what I did back there, Rick.
    I guess you were right. I’ve got a lot of repressed stuff.
    I need to deal with.
    Don’t worry about it, Morty.
    Remember those candy bars earlier that we got in the first act?
    Yeah, what about them?
    Turns out they have a chemical in them called purgenol that amplifies all your violent tendencies.
    Oh, boy. Whew! Thank goodness for that, huh?
    That’s a relief.
    Yep. Don’t even sweat.

EPISODE 10
<title>The Wedding Squanchers</title><airdate date="10/4/2015"></airdate>

[Open the Smith family house]

(The Smith Family is sat around a table having cereal for breakfast together.)

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Jerry, get a job.</speech>

(A knock is heard at the front door.)

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *Sighs and stands up to answer door*</speech>

(Jerry opens the door and flinches in fear as a large brain-resembling, automated delivery mechanism [a 'courier flap'] hovers into the house and makes its way into the dining room.)

Courier Flap: (In an automated machine voice) Delivery for Rick, Morty, Summer, Beth and Jerry.

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: *Drops spoon upon seeing the Courier Flap* Gross, what is that thing?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: It's a Courier Flap, it's like the Intergalactic version of UPS but less off-putting. *Reaches hand into courier and retrieves a metallic egg-shaped item*</speech>

OH SHIEEET! It looks like an egg-vite from Birdperson! It must be time for his annual Oscar party. By the way, our TV signals take lightyears to reach his planet, nobody tell him that Braveheart wins.

(Rick cracks the egg open like a regular egg. Upon cracking the egg, a miniature hologram emerges with Pachelbel's Canon playing in the background and videos of Tammy and Birdperson.)

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson's Voice: Greetings, this is Birdperson.</speech>

<speech designation="extra" character="tammy">Tammy's Voice: And Tammy!</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="birdperson">Birdperson's Voice: Inviting you to Planet Squanch for our mate-melding ceremony.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: (With disgust) Ughhhh... *places a napkin over the hologram and takes it to the bin in the kitchen)</speech>

<speech designation="extra" character="tammy">Tammy's Voice: (Muffled by napkin) If you're not a bird, that means we're getting married!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer: Oh my God! My friend Tammy's marrying Birdperson!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: What the hell is a 'Birdperson,'?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: He's Rick's best friend.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Uhhhh, l-l-let's not get carried away, Morty.</speech>

Courier Flaps: Would you like to RSVP or send a gift?

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away, *belch* I'd hang out with Jerry all day.</speech>

Courier Flap: Affirmative. Returning to sender. *flies towards front door*

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: No, hold on, stay... 'Courier Flaps.'</speech>

Courier Flap: *Turning back around and re-entering dining room* Staying.

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Dad, you have a friend that's getting married... that's a big deal.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="jerry">Jerry: *Scoffs* it's a big deal he has a friend.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: What do you know about friendship, Jerrrrrry?</speech>

Courier Flap: Confirm, shipping Jerry. *Hovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into sky*

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh God, Jerry?! *Runs to front door*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer and Morty: Dad?! *Follow Beth*</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: *Looking into sky* Where is it taking him?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *Still eating cereal* I assume Planet Squanch, 6000 lightyears across the galaxy.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="morty">Morty: Wh?-Wh- th-th-that's insane!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Yeah, I know. Now we have to go to the wedding.</speech>

[Trans. Rick, Summer, Beth and Morty flying through the galaxy in Rick's space cruiser while the radio plays techno music. The cruiser then flies down through the atmosphere of a clouded planet and lands on the surface of Planet Squanch.]

<speech designation="second" character="squanch">Squanchy: Rick Sanchez, you psycho bag of Squanch!</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: *Unscrewing and drinking from scotch flask* Hey, what's up, Squanchy?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="summer">Summer and Morty: *Morty waves* Heya Squanchy.</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="squanch">Squanchy: Morty, Summer! And you must be Beth. *kissing Beth's hand* Au squanché.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: *Holding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="rick">Rick: Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: Oh, okay... I squanch my family.</speech>

(Rick and Squanchy look at her with disgust and shock.)

<speech designation="second" character="squanch">Squanchy: Uhh...</speech>

<speech designation="main" character="beth">Beth: What? I do, I squanch my family.</speech>

<speech designation="second" character="squanch">Squanchy: Just stop saying it, gross.</speech>
