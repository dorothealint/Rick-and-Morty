<title>Look Who’s Purging Now</title><airdate date="9/27/2015"></airdate>

morty    I got to tell you, Rick. It’s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know?
    Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style.
rick    I agree, Morty. [ Belches ]
    It’s nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year.
morty    Ohh!
rick    Relax.
    That’s what windshields are for.
morty    I didn’t know that there were bugs out in space.
rick    Well, w-what did you think, Morty?
    Life just developed on earth by itself?
    Here, let me take care of this.
morty    Geez, Rick, that’s disgusting.
    I don’t want to look at that.
rick    Yeah, guess I’m out of fluid.
    L-let me find a place to stop.
    Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?
farmer    The general store ought to have what you need.
rick    Thanks.
farmer    Of course, you’ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown.
rick    Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why?
farmer    Sundown is when the festival begins.
morty    The festival?
farmer    Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace.
rick    Oh, I know what this is!
    You’ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence.
farmer    That’s right.
morty    What?!
rick    It’s like "the purge," Morty. That movie "the purge"?
farmer    Oh, have you been here before?
rick    No, no, but I’ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick.
    You know, sometimes it’s called the cleansing or the red time.
    There was this one world that called it just murder night.
    I-it’s a purge planet.
    They’re peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge.
morty    T-that’s horrible!
rick    Yeah.
    You want to check it out?
    Theme music♪
    [ Electricity crackling ]
rick    So, what do you do during the festival?
    You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff?
gstoreonwer    Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff.
rick    Oh, I bet you do, old timer. [ Laughs ]
morty    Gee... Rick, come on. The sun is setting.
    W-we got to get out of here.
rick    All right, well, w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid?
gstoreowner    It’s on the house. Oh, and, uh, why... why don’t you have some candy bars, as well?
rick    Oh, no way. That’s really nice of you.
gstoreowner    I’m a nice guy... For now.
rick    [ Chuckling ] Ohh, I don’t doubt it.
morty    Rick!
rick    Yeah, yeah.
    Hey, have a good festival, old timer.
gstoreowner    I intend to.
morty    Rick, unlock it!
rick    Just a second, Morty.
    Oh, look at that sunset.
morty    Stop screwing around.
    [ Click ]
rick    There we go. Much better. Now we can see.
morty    Great.
rick    Hey, you know what, Morty?
    Why don’t we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it?
morty    What?! No! What is your problem?!
rick    Morty, grow up. If you don’t want to watch, don’t watch, but, you know, it’s my car.
    [ Belches ] Also, if you tell your mom about this, I’ll purge you.
morty    You’re the worst.
    And this planet is the worst. How can you be into this?
    You know, people are gonna kill each other.
rick    So, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that [belches] I-if... if there’s a video online with someone getting decapitated, you don’t click on it?
morty    No!
    Why... why would I do that?
    You do that?
rick    I don’t, because it would bore me.
    I see shit like that for breakfast, Morty.
    But if you don’t do it, I say it’s because you’re afraid of your own primal instincts.
    So you stuff them down and...
    [ Bell chiming ]
    Oh, oh! Shh. Shh. It’s starting.
    Oh-ho-ho! Here we go.
morty    I’m not watching.
rick    Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal’s in the mail.
    I’m gonna get a closer look.
morty    Oh, okay, sure.
    And then someone’s gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we’re gonna crash and we’re gonna be stuck down there and it’s gonna be what we deserve.
rick    Yawn.
    Whoa! [ Indistinct shouting ]
    Whoa, they are purging the F[Bleep] out of each other.
    [ Muffled screaming ]
    Oh, my God!
    Oh [Bleep]
    That was... okay, yeah. T-that was gross.
    Wow. Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, Morty. Ugh.
    My appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick.
    Oh, God. [ Grunts ]
    [ Retching ]
    [ Woman screaming ]
girl    Get away from me!
    No! No! Help!
    Somebody help me! Aah!
rick    All right, Morty. L-let’s get out of here.
morty    Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. W-we have to go down there.
rick    [ Belching ] What? Why?
morty    That poor girl. W-we have to save her.
rick    Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy. We got the wiper fluid.
    We watched them kill each other. We’re leaving.
morty    Help me save that girl, or I’m telling mom you brought me here.
rick    You little turd. [ Screaming ]
girl    Please! Leave me alone!
msn    Leave you alone? During a purge?
man    I don’t think so, baby.
morty    It’s okay. We’re not gonna hurt you.
    My name is Morty. This is my grandpa.
    We’re tourists.
rick    Not anymore.
    Aah!
    Aah!
    Oh, my God. This is [Bleep] awesome!
    Morty, this is really cool.
    Hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people?
    It’s fun. We’re totally justified because we’re saving a little girl.
    I mean, w-w-we’re both free and clear to murder these people.
morty    Are you okay?
girl    Yes.
    I have to find somewhere to hide.
morty    Well, you can hide with us. Rick?
rick    Yeah?
morty    Do you think we could take... w-what’s your name?
girl    Arthrisha.
morty    Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge?
rick    Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you’ve done to blackmail me?
girl    Your vehicle... is it from the gods?
morty    No.
rick    Yes.
morty    So, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like, "wait, what?"
    This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?"
girl    Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it.
morty    Yeah, I bet. [ Chuckles ] I bet.
    Yeah, it’s kind of like cellphones, you know?
    At first, everyone was like, "look at those douchebags purging," and then the next thing you know, they’re like, "it’s just so convenient."
rick    Geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, Morty?
jerry    Whatcha doing?
    Watching some TV, playing on your phone?
summer    Is that a real question?
jerry    Just making conversation.
summer    Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with?
summer    My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark "yes" like a trained animal.
    It’s not a conversation.
    You’re holding me verbally hostage.
jerry    Okay, ass-face. I’ll go in the kitchen.
summer    Hey, dad.
jerry    Yeah?
summer    Whatcha doing?
    Going into the kitchen?
jerry    Okay.
summer    Yeah, you like that?
jerry    Screw you.
morty    So, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge?
girl    I-I don’t want to answer any more purge questions.
morty    All right, hey, hey, that’s cool.
    I can roll with that.
    [rick Blowing raspberries ]
girl    [ Gasps ] My Nana!
rick    Huh?
girl    My Nana! We have to save her!
rick    You just now remembered your Nana exists.
girl    I-I was traumatized.
rick    Haven’t you been through like 15 purges?
    I mean, some as a child?
girl    Will somebody just help me get her?
rick    Fine, whatever. Morty, stay.
morty    Oh, God. Oh, crap. Oh, crap!
girl    Get out! Get out!
morty    Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
girl    Get the [Bleep] out of the flying machine!
morty    Oh, my God! O-okay! Okay!
girl    Back up, asshole.
    [ Whimpers ]
girl    Back up.
morty    Ohh.
girl    Back the [Bleep] up!
morty    Aah!
girl    For what it’s worth, I’m sorry, but that’s not really worth anything tonight, is it?
morty    Y-you can’t leave us here. You’re killing us!
    You hear me? Come back.
    Y-you got to come back. Change your mind.
    Oh, geez.
rick    Morty! Aah! [Bleep] Amish bitch shot me!
    [ Grunts ] She tried to purge me, Morty.
    You let your wiener do the walking, and now I’m dead.
morty    Rick, she took the car!
rick    You [Bleep] kidding me, Morty?!
    She took my car and the gun.
    We’re like the rest of these assholes now.
    W-w-we’re gonna get purged, Morty.
    Help me up.
morty    Oh, geez, geez! Wait a minute, Rick.
    Why don’t we just use your portal gun?
rick    It’s in the car, dip-ass.
    [ Grunts ] Oh, God, it hurts.
    She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty.
    It’s the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it. I hope it was worth it.
morty    I was just trying to do right.
rick    Yeah, well, that’s not really the theme of tonight’s party.
    Heads up. Rapists.
    Well, don’t just stand there, Morty.
    Purge ‘em.
morty    Me?
rick    No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them?
    Pick up a stick or something and kill them.
morty    Um, w-we come in peace.
    [ Screaming ]
rick    Oh, my God. [ Grunts ]
    There’s more where that came from!
    You want to get purged, you bring it!
    Drop [Belches] drop your sh1t! Drop it all.
    Morty, go get their sh1t. Hurry up.
    I only had one of those things I threw.
    I’m holding a box of tic tacs right now.
jerry    Want some crackers?
summer    No, thank you.
jerry    Are you ready to be nice to me?
summer    In exchange for crackers?
jerry    What happened to you?
summer    Dad, get a job.
jerry    You’re trying to create drama because you’re bored.
summer    Oh. [ Beeping, whirring ]
    It’s the space phone grandpa gave us.
    Hello?
rick    Hey, Summer, it’s grandpa.
    I need you to do me a favor.
summer    I can barely hear you.
jerry    Who is it?
rick    Morty and I are on a planet that’s purging.
    I need you to take down...
summer    A plan that’s what?
rick    We’re on a planet that’s purging, Summer. Purging.
    We lost our car and my gun, and we’re in a purge.
jerry    Ooh, is it taddi Mason?
summer    Like the movie "the purge"?
rick    Yes, I-I need you to take... that movie sucked.
summer    Oh, my God. Hold on.
    It’s not taddi Mason?
    Dad, who the [Bleep] is taddi Mason?
    My friend.
summer    Aah!
    Are you okay? I’m putting you on speaker.
jerry    Taddi?
rick    Yes, Jerry, it’s taddi, a person no one’s ever heard of until now, calling you on a space phone.
    I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic.
rick    [ Growls ]
    Aah!
    [ Growling ]
    [ Gunshots ]
    Reload, fast.
morty    Summer, w-we need you to take down this number.
    Quit screwing around.
jerry     Morty? Are you all right?
morty    No!
jerry    Why are you with taddi Mason?
morty    Holy [Bleep] dad! Shut the [Bleep] up!
jerry    Okay. I guess I’m just this entire family’s toilet paper.
moty    Are you writing this down? Will you please write this down?
summer     Yes, yes.
rick    7-7-1-9-8...[ Growling ] 3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5. Aah! [ Growling ] You son of a bitch! Morty, I don’t want to be the "a little help" guy, but a little help? Aah!
summer    Okay, I have a pen. Go.
rick    7-7-1-9-8-3- 6-4-2-1-1-2-5. A spoon, Morty? A spoon?!
morty    I’m sorry.
rick    There’s a pile of silverware next to you, and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything?
morty    All right, okay!
rick    Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there’s a red box with a keypad on it. You’re gonna take that box outside, and you’re gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad. Got it?
summer    Got it. Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad?
rick    I’m ignoring you. Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse, I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package. Just remember, if there’s people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first.
morty    We’re not purging anyone, Rick, all right? W-will you stop it?
rick    Morty, if we’re gonna survive tonight, you’re gonna need to harness your repressed rage.
morty    I don’t have any!
rick    Spoken like a person with repressed rage.
    [ Doorbell rings ]
lighthouse keeper    I take no part in the festival. If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly.
rick    No such agenda, chief.
morty    We’re not too keen on the purge, either, sir. We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth. It’s a different planet.
rick    By the way, life on other planets exists. Don’t let it distract you.
lighthouse keeper    I’ll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending on the condition that you listen to my tale.
morty    Okay.
rick    Deal. All right, I’m gonna go to the roof and set things up. Morty, you listen to his tale.
morty    Okay.
lighthouse keeper    [ Clears throat ]
    "Fade in. Exterior. Unnamed city. Day."
    The hustle and bustle is a symphony of progress.
    We pan past windows, each of which contain a different story, to find jacey lakims, 28... hot, but doesn’t know it.
    Jacey stops when her high heel gets caught in the grating of a sewer.
    Suddenly, a man steps into frame and points a gun at her.
    This is not her day.
    Fade to black.
    "Title... ‘three weeks earlier.’"
jerry    [ sighs ] You really don’t want to talk to me about this.
summer    Dad, grandpa and Morty are in danger. You’re unemployed, and you’re bored. They’re a higher priority.
jerry    Stop saying I’m unemployed!
summer    Okay, 7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-1 2... aah!
jerry    Good lord! Now what? [ Whirring, humming ] Look, I’m your father, and I love you is all I’m saying. I’ll leave it at that.
summer    Fine, dad!
    [ Both scream ]
    Oh, he might have said to take it outside.
rick    Come on, Summer. How hard is it to type some numbers into a box? Target locked. [ Device beeps ] Oh, thank God. Well, I did my job. Summer did her job.
    Now all Morty has to do is finish listening to that tale.
lighthouse keeper    "Blane: Maybe I don’t need a new friend."
    Jacey: Maybe you’re the only friend I need.
    Blane: Need, or want?
    Jacey: I’ve never been much for wanting.
    "Blane: Spoken like someone with needs."
morty    Oh, geez.
lighthouse keeper    Hmm?
morty    Uh, sorry. K-keep going.
lighthouse keeper    "Jacey reaches out and touches his face."
    It’s clear he needs what she wants.
    She’s a woman. He’s a man.
    The city burns in the background as he takes her in his arms.
    Fade out.
    Title... ‘the end’...
    "Question mark."
morty    Wow.
lighthouse keeper    Yeah?
morty    It’s... G-good job. Good job.
lighthouse keeper    You liked it?
morty    Of course I did.
lighthouse keeper    You didn’t laugh at the scene in the bar.
morty    I...Thought it was funny, but I wanted to hear the rest.
lighthouse keeper    Do you have any thoughts? Notes?
morty    No. I-I just enjoyed it. That’s my note, you know? Please write more.
lighthouse keeper    Seems a little insincere.
morty    What? No.
lighthouse keeper    You don’t have to mollycoddle me. I want to improve my writing. Tell me your real thoughts.
morty    All right. Well, um, I’m not a huge fan, personally, of the whole "three weeks earlier" teaser thing. I feel like, you know, we should start our stories where they begin not start them where they get interest... 
lighthouse keeperget out.
morty    Um, what?
lighthouse keeper    No, I’m sick of this. You bang on my door, you beg me to help you, I share something personal with you, and you take a giant sh1t on it.
morty    Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon... 
lighthouse keeper   well, you can’t. I want you out of here. You’re a petty person, and you’re insecure, and you’re taking it out on me. That’s a good script.
morty    What the hell?!
lighthouse keeper    I don’t care. I want you out.
rick    What?
lighthouse keeper    Take that thing down. Your grandson is a shitty person. Leave now.
rick    Morty!
morty    Rick, I didn’t do anything. I sat through his entire screenplay... 
lighthouse keeper    you "sat through it"?
morty    Yes! Did you want me to weep with joy? It’s terrible!
rick    Whoa! Morty! We’re guests here.
morty    I tried to be a good guest! He dragged it out of me!
lighthouse keeper    I’m taking down this beacon.
morty    No, stop! That’s not fair! Just because you hate your own writing doesn’t make me a bad person!
lighthouse keeper    Aah!
morty    You like that? You want me to cut to three weeks earlier when you were alive?
rick    Whoa, Morty. You just purged. [Beacon arriving. Device beeps ] Okay, time to go.
[smith house]
jerry    Well, terrific.
summer    [ Sighs ] Dad, what’s going on? What’s the deal here?
jerry    I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter. You’re growing up so fast. You used to be my little girl.
    [ Chuckles ] Yeah.
jerry    Remember when we used to go to the playground, and I’d push you on the swings?
summer    Oh, you could push me higher than all the other kids.
jerry    You were so small and cute. I thought you were gonna fly right off into the street.
summer    [ Chuckling ] I used to pee my pants.
jerry    I know, and now look at you! You have a job. You’re making really good money. You’re not paying any rent, so you have plenty of disposable income.
summer    Oh, God, dad. Please, don’t.
jerry    I just need a few hundred dollars to get through the month. I have some interviews coming up. Something’s gonna come through. I can feel it.
summer    I’m going inside.
    [ Door shuts ]
jerry    [ Sighs ] I guess this is what rock bottom feels like, Jerry.

morty     Ow! 
rick      It’s okay, Morty. It’s the purge, you know? Pushing old lighthouse keepers down the stairs is totally cool.
morty    It’s not cool, Rick. I-I’m not like these people. I can’t run around chopping people’s heads off one day a year and then sleep well the rest of the time.
rick    Well, you better start getting used to it, little bitch, because we got some [Bleep] company.
pursuers    Hey, there he is.
rick    Here I am. [ Beacon whirring ] Morty. Time to [Belches] purge.

    But this girl is one of your poor people, and I guess you guys felt like it was okay to subject her to inhuman conditions because there was no chance of it ever hurting you.
    It’s sort of the socio-political equivalent of, say, a suit of power armor around you.
    But now things are evened out, so, arthrisha?
    [ All gasp ]
    Happy festival [Bleep] suckers!
    Suck my [Bleep] chew my balls!
    Suck my huge [Bleep]

girl    Hey, thanks for helping me, Rick. You’re a pretty great guy.
rick    Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Bleep] You for shooting my liver. I’ll see you around.
morty    Oh, man. What... what happened?
rick    Don’t worry about it, Morty. Listen, if you wanted to try to get a piece, you better hurry up. Now’s your last chance.
morty    Hey, hey, arthrisha, um, maybe I could... 
girl   uh, I have a boyfriend.
morty    Okay.
girl    I’m not trying to be rude. I just... I don’t want to lead you on.
morty    I-I-I understand.
girl    I mean, thank you so much for helping end the festival, but I have a boyfriend, and, uh, he’s just... 
morty   okay, okay, you can stop saying it. I took it okay the first time, and now you’re just repeating stuff.
girl    Oh, I’m sorry.
morty    It’s okay.
girl    Oh, you’re so sweet, I just... oh, but I can’t.
morty    Yeah, you’re still doing it.
hick    It won’t be easy creating a new society from the ground up.
rick    Well, a helpful rule might be if you need something, you get it.
    Pretty simple, right?
farmer    I need food.
rick    Who’s got food for that guy?
baker    I do, but this is for me.
rick    Can’t you make some more?
baker    Oh, sure. And while I’m making food for everyone, who takes care of my kids?
woman    I’ll take care of your kids, if I get some extra food for it.
baker    Extra food?
woman    Well, I’m not gonna do extra work if we all get the same.
rick    All right, okay, fair is fair.If you do extra work, you get extra food.
    Oh. [ All murmuring ]
baker    Who’s gonna keep track of who gets how much food for how much work?
hick    Hello. I can do that. I’ll keep track of everyone’s food, you know, in exchange for food.
baker    That’s not a real job!
hick    Oh, and making food is?
baker    You son of a bitch! Eat this!
    [ All screaming ]
farmer    Guys, guys, guys, guys, whoa, whoa.
    Cool it, now. Take it easy.
    There’s too much aggression here.
    What if we designate a period of time during which we can all get this hate, murder, and rage out of our system...
morty    I can’t help but feel ashamed about what I did back there, Rick. I guess you were right. I’ve got a lot of repressed stuff. I need to deal with.
rick    Don’t worry about it, Morty. Remember those candy bars earlier that we got in the first act?
morty    Yeah, what about them?
rick    Turns out they have a chemical in them called purgenol that amplifies all your violent tendencies.
morty    Oh, boy. Whew! Thank goodness for that, huh? That’s a relief.
rick    Yep. Don’t even sweat. You’re still the same old Morty. Your character’s totally protected.
